# Tracking System Changes

## What Changed
Removed the tracking file (`transcribed_episodes.json`) completely. The transcriber now simply checks if a VTT file already exists before transcribing.

## Why This is Better (KISS)
- **No sync needed**: VTT file existence is the single source of truth for transcription
- **No complex dependencies**: Transcriber doesn't need Neo4j connection
- **No tracking file**: One less thing to maintain or get out of sync
- **Simple logic**: If VTT exists → skip transcription

## How It Works Now
1. Transcriber checks: Does `data/transcripts/podcast_name/episode.vtt` exist?
   - Yes → Skip transcription
   - No → Transcribe and save VTT
2. Seeding pipeline checks Neo4j (unchanged)
   - Already processed → Skip
   - Not processed → Extract knowledge and save to Neo4j

## Testing
Run `./test_simple_tracking.sh` to verify the new behavior.

## Note
The old tracking file (`transcriber/data/transcribed_episodes.json`) can be deleted - it's no longer used.
