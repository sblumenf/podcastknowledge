This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This project is part of a bigger app.  The overall app is a podcast knowlede discovery app.  This project will seed the discovery tool.  This is the **ONLY** functionality for this project - it should expect a folder of VVT transcripts, extract knowledge from them, build a knowledge graph and populate a neo4j database.  NOTHING ELSE.

## Technology Expansion

The intrudction of new tools, frameworks, models, databases, etc. **MUST** be pre-approved by a human user.  UNDER NO CRICUMSTANCE should a new technology be introduced with formal sign off from a human user.
