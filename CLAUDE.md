# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This project is part of a bigger app.  The overall app is a podcast knowlede discovery app.  This project will seed the discovery tool.  This is the **ONLY** functionality for this project - it should expect a folder of VVT transcripts, extract knowledge from them, build a knowledge graph and populate a neo4j database.  NOTHING ELSE.

## Technology Expansion

The intrudction of new tools, frameworks, models, databases, etc. **MUST** be pre-approved by a human user.  UNDER NO CRICUMSTANCE should a new technology be introduced with formal sign off from a human user.

## Plan Following

Always follow plans explicitly.  Do not deviate from the plan without explicit approval from a human user.  Do not introduce new features or functionality without explicit approval from a human user.

## Estimation Guidelines

Never provide cost or time estimates when generating an anlysis or a plan.  These are usually inventions

## Cleanup

Make sure to clean up all temporary files and directories when you are done with them.  Do not leave any temporary files or directories in the project.
