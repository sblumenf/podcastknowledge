# Current Enhancements for Podcast Knowledge System

This document outlines enhancements that should be implemented during the initial knowledge base seeding phase.

## Essential Enhancements

### 1. Basic Sentiment Analysis
- Add sentiment scores to segments during extraction
- Store sentiment polarity (positive/negative/neutral)
- Add sentiment trends across episode duration
- Include sentiment relationship to topics/entities

### 2. Speaker Information Enhancement
- Improve speaker diarization accuracy
- Store speaker metadata (host vs. guest, etc.)
- Track speaker-topic relationships
- Record speaking patterns (monologues vs. dialogues)

### 3. Embedding Quality Improvements
- Ensure high-quality embeddings for segments and entities
- Use the latest embedding models (like text-embedding-3-large)
- Optimize embedding parameters for podcast content
- Store multiple embedding types for different query purposes

### 4. Metadata Enrichment
- Add timestamps to all entities, insights, and segments
- Store publication dates for episodes to enable future time-based analysis
- Ensure proper categorization of insights and entities
- Include domain-specific taxonomies for better organization

### 5. Entity Relationship Foundations
- Store entity-to-entity relationships in the graph
- Include confidence scores for entity detection
- Store entity importance/centrality metrics
- Track entity mentions across multiple episodes

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these enhancements:

1. Ensure all added fields are properly indexed in Neo4j
2. Document the schema changes and data formats
3. Validate sentiment scores against human evaluation for a sample set
4. Test speaker diarization against manual transcriptions for accuracy
5. Benchmark embedding quality for retrieval tasks
