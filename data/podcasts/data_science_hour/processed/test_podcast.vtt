00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Host>Welcome to our podcast about technology and innovation.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Host>Today we're talking with Jane Smith, CEO of TechCorp, about the future of artificial intelligence.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:25.000
<v Jane Smith>Thank you for having me. I'm excited to discuss how AI is transforming businesses.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:35.000
<v Jane Smith>At TechCorp, we've developed several AI products that help companies automate their workflows.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Host>That's fascinating. Can you tell us more about your flagship product?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000
<v Jane Smith>Our main product is called "SmartFlow", and it uses machine learning to optimize business processes.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Jane Smith>We've seen companies reduce operational costs by up to 40% using our software.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Host>Those are impressive numbers. How do you see AI evolving in the next five years?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Jane Smith>I believe we'll see AI become more integrated into everyday business operations. 
It won't be a separate tool, but rather embedded in everything we do.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000
<v Host>Thank you for sharing your insights. That's all for today's episode.
