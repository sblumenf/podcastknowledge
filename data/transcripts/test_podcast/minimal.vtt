Welcome to our minimal test episode.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is a simple VTT file with just five captions.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We use this for basic testing scenarios.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It helps verify core VTT parsing functionality.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Thank you for listening to this minimal example.
