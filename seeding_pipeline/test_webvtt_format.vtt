00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Host>Hello everyone, welcome to our podcast about artificial intelligence.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Host>Today we're going to discuss how machine learning is transforming healthcare.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
<v Host>I'm joined by Dr. Sarah Johnson, who is a leading researcher in medical AI applications.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
<v Dr. Sarah Johnson>Thanks for having me. I'm excited to share our recent findings.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:35.000
<v Dr. Sarah Johnson>We've discovered that AI can detect certain types of cancer with 95% accuracy, which is remarkable.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Host>That's incredible! Can you tell us more about how the technology works?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000
<v Dr. Sarah Johnson>Certainly. The system uses deep learning neural networks trained on thousands of medical images.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Dr. Sarah Johnson>It can identify patterns that even experienced doctors might miss.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Host>What are the main challenges you face in implementing this technology?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000
<v Dr. Sarah Johnson>The biggest challenge is ensuring data privacy and getting regulatory approval.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:35.000
<v Dr. Sarah Johnson>We also need to make sure the technology is accessible to hospitals of all sizes.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Host>That makes sense. What do you see as the future of AI in healthcare?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Dr. Sarah Johnson>I believe AI will become a standard tool for diagnosis and treatment planning within the next decade.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:10.000
<v Dr. Sarah Johnson>It won't replace doctors, but it will augment their capabilities significantly.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.000
<v Host>Thank you so much for sharing your insights, Dr. Johnson. This has been fascinating.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:30.000
<v Dr. Sarah Johnson>My pleasure. I'm always happy to discuss how we can use technology to improve patient outcomes.
