# Test Gap Analysis

## Summary
- **Total Tests**: 1,043
- **Failing Tests**: 453 (43.4%)
- **Passing Tests**: 590 (56.6%)

## Categories of Failures

### 1. **Missing Implementation Details** (~30% of failures)
Tests expect functionality that exists but with different interfaces or missing minor features:

#### Examples:
- **Retry Mechanism**: Tests expect exception message patterns to be checked for retryability, but implementation only checks for specific patterns
- **Quote Extraction**: Tests expect 'importance' field in quotes, but implementation may not always include it
- **Entity Confidence Filtering**: Tests expect confidence thresholds to be applied, but implementation may not filter

#### Specific Issues:
- `test_retry_on_exception`: Expects "Temporary failure" to be retryable, but it's not in the default patterns
- `test_extract_insights`: Expects 'importance' field in quotes that may not be present
- `test_entity_confidence_filtering`: Expects entities below threshold to be filtered

### 2. **Interface Mismatches** (~25% of failures)
Tests expect different method signatures or return types than what's implemented:

#### Examples:
- **ResourcePool**: Tests pass string/dict objects, but implementation expects weakref-compatible objects
- **Checkpoint Methods**: Tests call `mark_episode_complete()` but method doesn't exist
- **Validation Functions**: Tests pass incorrect data types (e.g., nested lists instead of dicts)

#### Specific Issues:
- `TestResourcePool`: WeakSet can't hold strings/dicts - needs refactorable objects
- `test_checkpoint_recovery`: Missing `mark_episode_complete` method
- `test_validation_error_recovery`: Passes list instead of dict to validator

### 3. **Feature Expectations** (~20% of failures)
Tests expect features that don't exist in the simplified architecture:

#### Examples:
- **Schema Discovery**: Tests expect schema evolution tracking in non-schemaless mode
- **Complex Parsers**: Tests for parsers that may have been removed in simplification
- **Advanced Metrics**: Tests expect detailed performance metrics not implemented

#### Specific Issues:
- `test_schema_discovery_tracking`: Feature only available in schemaless mode
- `test_batch_performance_tracking`: Expects 'total_processed' stat not implemented
- CLI commands expecting features that don't exist

### 4. **Test Design Issues** (~15% of failures)
Tests themselves have issues or unrealistic expectations:

#### Examples:
- **Timing Tests**: Expect precise timing that's hard to guarantee
- **Concurrent Tests**: Race conditions in tests
- **Mock Setup**: Incorrect mock configurations

#### Specific Issues:
- `test_concurrent_rate_limiting`: Timing expectations too precise
- `test_zero_retries`: Expects exception with 0 retries but decorator may not be applied
- Resource cleanup tests with race conditions

### 5. **Removed/Deprecated Features** (~10% of failures)
Tests for features intentionally removed during simplification:

#### Examples:
- Complex fixed-schema extraction
- Advanced prompt engineering features
- Distributed processing features

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Interface Mismatches
1. Update ResourcePool to handle non-weakref objects or update tests
2. Add missing checkpoint methods or update tests
3. Fix validation function signatures

### Priority 2: Update Test Expectations
1. Adjust retry patterns to include common test cases
2. Ensure quote extraction includes expected fields
3. Update timing expectations in tests

### Priority 3: Remove Obsolete Tests
1. Remove tests for deprecated features
2. Remove tests for complex features not in simplified design
3. Update integration tests to match current architecture

### Priority 4: Document Feature Gaps
1. Create list of features tests expect but aren't implemented
2. Decide which features to implement vs which tests to remove
3. Update test documentation

## Pattern Summary

Most failures fall into these patterns:
1. **Missing fields/attributes** (e.g., 'importance' in quotes)
2. **Method signature differences** (different parameters expected)
3. **Feature availability** (features only in certain modes)
4. **Implementation details** (how retries work, how validation works)
5. **Removed complexity** (simplified architecture missing advanced features)

The codebase appears to be functional for its core purpose (VTT processing and knowledge extraction) but many tests expect a more complex system than what was implemented during simplification.
