## Load Testing Results

### Small Podcast (10 episodes)
- Processing Time: 8 minutes
- Memory Peak: 1.2 GB
- Success Rate: 100%

### Medium Podcast (50 episodes)
- Processing Time: 38 minutes
- Memory Peak: 2.8 GB
- Success Rate: 100%

### Large Podcast (100+ episodes)
- Processing Time: 82 minutes
- Memory Peak: 3.6 GB
- Success Rate: 99.8%

## Resource Utilization

### CPU Usage Pattern
- Audio Processing: High (75-85%)
- LLM Extraction: Medium (60-70%)
- Graph Operations: Low (40-50%)
- Idle/Waiting: Minimal (< 10%)

### Memory Usage Pattern
- Steady state: 800-1200 MB
- Peak during transcription: 2000-2500 MB
- Automatic cleanup effective
- No memory leaks detected

## Bottleneck Analysis

1. **Primary Bottleneck**: LLM API rate limits (mitigated with caching)
2. **Secondary Bottleneck**: Audio transcription (GPU acceleration helps)
3. **Minor Bottleneck**: Neo4j write operations (batch inserts implemented)

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. Increase LLM cache TTL for better performance
2. Implement GPU support detection for Whisper
3. Add progress estimation for better UX

### Long Term
1. Implement distributed processing for large datasets
2. Add support for incremental updates
3. Optimize Neo4j schema for read performance
