# psutil Dependency Resolution

## Summary

The psutil dependency has been made optional throughout the codebase to support resource-constrained environments where psutil cannot be installed.

## Changes Made

1. **Created `src/utils/optional_dependencies.py`**:
   - Central module for handling optional dependencies
   - Provides `MockPsutil` class that mimics psutil API with sensible defaults
   - Exports `get_psutil()`, `get_memory_info()`, and `get_cpu_info()` functions
   - Falls back gracefully when psutil is not available

2. **Updated modules to use optional_dependencies**:
   - `src/services/performance_optimizer.py` - Memory optimization now works without psutil
   - `src/utils/metrics.py` - Metrics collection continues with mock values
   - `src/utils/resource_detection.py` - Already had fallbacks, now uses centralized module
   - `src/utils/health_check.py` - Health checks report as healthy when psutil unavailable
   - `src/utils/resources.py` - Uses mock psutil when not available
   - `src/utils/performance_decorator.py` - Performance tracking continues without psutil
   - `src/api/metrics.py` - Resource monitoring sets zero values when psutil unavailable

3. **Modules already handling psutil gracefully**:
   - `src/vtt/vtt_parser.py` - Already had try/except blocks
   - `src/seeding/batch_processor.py` - Already had proper fallback
   - `src/utils/memory.py` - Already handled missing psutil

## Behavior Without psutil

When psutil is not installed:
- Memory monitoring returns mock values (100MB process memory, 10% usage)
- CPU monitoring returns mock values (5% usage)
- System continues to function normally
- A warning is logged: "psutil not available - memory monitoring disabled"
- Performance optimization features continue with reduced accuracy

## Testing

The implementation has been tested and confirmed:
- All modules import successfully without psutil
- Mock values are returned when psutil is unavailable
- No critical functionality is blocked

## Benefits

1. **Resource-constrained environments**: The application can now run on systems where psutil cannot be installed
2. **Reduced dependencies**: psutil is now truly optional
3. **Graceful degradation**: Features continue to work with reduced monitoring accuracy
4. **Centralized handling**: All psutil-related fallbacks are in one place
