# Design Decisions and Trade-offs

This document captures the key design decisions made during the refactoring of the podcast knowledge graph pipeline and explains the rationale behind each choice.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Provider Pattern for External Services

**Decision**: Use a provider pattern with interfaces for all external services (audio, LLM, graph, embeddings).

**Rationale**:
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations (e.g., Whisper → AssemblyAI, Gemini → GPT-4)
- **Testability**: Mock providers enable unit testing without external dependencies
- **Extensibility**: Third parties can add custom providers via plugins

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Loose coupling between core logic and external services
- ✅ Better testing and development experience
- ❌ Additional abstraction layer adds complexity
- ❌ Potential performance overhead from interfaces

### 2. Dependency Injection Over Global State

**Decision**: Use dependency injection to pass providers and configuration to components.

**Rationale**:
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation with mock dependencies
- **Flexibility**: Different configurations for different environments
- **Clarity**: Explicit dependencies make code easier to understand

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ No hidden dependencies or global state
- ✅ Easier to reason about component behavior
- ❌ More verbose constructors and initialization
- ❌ Need to pass dependencies through multiple layers

### 3. Separation of Processing Logic

**Decision**: Split processing into distinct modules (segmentation, extraction, entity resolution, etc.).

**Rationale**:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clear purpose
- **Reusability**: Modules can be used independently
- **Maintainability**: Easier to modify or extend individual components

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Easier to test individual components
- ❌ More files and modules to manage
- ❌ Potential for over-engineering simple operations

## API Design Decisions

### 4. Versioned API with Backward Compatibility

**Decision**: Implement versioned API (v1) with guaranteed backward compatibility.

**Rationale**:
- **Stability**: Users can rely on consistent interfaces
- **Evolution**: Can add features without breaking existing code
- **Migration**: Clear upgrade path between versions

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ API stability for external consumers
- ✅ Can deprecate features gracefully
- ❌ Need to maintain multiple versions
- ❌ Constraints on internal refactoring

### 5. Simple Function-Based API

**Decision**: Provide `seed_podcast()` and `seed_podcasts()` as primary API.

**Rationale**:
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and use
- **Convenience**: Handles lifecycle management internally
- **Focus**: Clear primary use case

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Very simple to get started
- ✅ Hides complexity from users
- ❌ Less control for advanced users
- ❌ May need to expose more options over time

## Data Model Decisions

### 6. Dataclasses for Models

**Decision**: Use Python dataclasses for all data models.

**Rationale**:
- **Type Safety**: Clear type annotations
- **Immutability**: Can use frozen dataclasses
- **Serialization**: Easy JSON conversion
- **Validation**: Can add validators

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Modern Python best practice
- ✅ Good IDE support
- ❌ Requires Python 3.7+
- ❌ Less flexible than dictionaries

### 7. Graph-First Data Model

**Decision**: Design data models to map directly to graph nodes and relationships.

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: Efficient graph operations
- **Clarity**: Clear mapping between code and database
- **Querying**: Natural graph traversals

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Optimized for graph database
- ✅ Rich relationship modeling
- ❌ Less portable to other storage systems
- ❌ May need transformation for other uses

## Processing Decisions

### 8. Checkpoint-Based Recovery

**Decision**: Implement checkpoint system for resuming interrupted processing.

**Rationale**:
- **Reliability**: Can recover from failures
- **Efficiency**: Don't reprocess completed work
- **User Experience**: Seamless resume capability

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Robust against interruptions
- ✅ Saves time and resources
- ❌ Additional storage overhead
- ❌ Complexity in state management

### 9. Batch Processing with Configurable Size

**Decision**: Process segments in batches rather than one at a time.

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: Better throughput with LLM APIs
- **Efficiency**: Fewer API calls
- **Cost**: Reduced API costs

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Much faster processing
- ✅ Lower API costs
- ❌ Higher memory usage
- ❌ All-or-nothing batch failures

### 10. Parallel Processing Support

**Decision**: Support parallel processing with configurable workers.

**Rationale**:
- **Speed**: Utilize multiple CPU cores
- **Throughput**: Process multiple episodes simultaneously
- **Scalability**: Better resource utilization

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Significant performance improvement
- ✅ Scales with hardware
- ❌ Thread safety complexity
- ❌ Resource contention issues

## Error Handling Decisions

### 11. Fail-Safe Over Fail-Fast

**Decision**: Continue processing even when some episodes fail.

**Rationale**:
- **Robustness**: Partial success is better than total failure
- **User Experience**: Get results even with some errors
- **Practicality**: Real-world data is messy

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ More resilient to bad data
- ✅ Better user experience
- ❌ May hide serious issues
- ❌ Need careful error tracking

### 12. Comprehensive Error Context

**Decision**: Include detailed context in all error messages.

**Rationale**:
- **Debugging**: Easier to diagnose issues
- **Support**: Better error reports from users
- **Learning**: Understand failure patterns

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Much easier debugging
- ✅ Better user support
- ❌ Larger log files
- ❌ Potential sensitive data in logs

## Performance Decisions

### 13. Memory Management Strategy

**Decision**: Implement explicit memory cleanup and monitoring.

**Rationale**:
- **Stability**: Prevent memory leaks
- **Long Runs**: Support processing large podcasts
- **Monitoring**: Track memory usage

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Stable for long-running processes
- ✅ Predictable memory usage
- ❌ Additional overhead
- ❌ Complexity in cleanup logic
