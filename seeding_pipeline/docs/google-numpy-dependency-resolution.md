# Google and NumPy Dependency Resolution

## Summary

Made google-generativeai and numpy optional dependencies to support resource-constrained environments.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `src/utils/optional_google.py`
- Provides mock for google.generativeai module
- Returns zero-valued embeddings when Google AI is not available
- Maintains API compatibility with real Gemini service

### 2. Updated `src/services/embeddings_gemini.py`
- Made google-generativeai import optional
- Made numpy import optional
- Added pure Python fallback for cosine similarity calculation
- Service works with mock embeddings when dependencies are missing

### 3. Fixed Import Issues in `conversation_analyzer.py`
- Commented out missing `trace_operation` decorator
- Changed `ProcessingError` to `PipelineError` (correct exception class)

## Behavior Without Dependencies

### Without google-generativeai:
- Embeddings service returns 768-dimensional zero vectors
- Warning logged: "google-generativeai not available - using mock embeddings"
- System continues to function for testing/development

### Without numpy:
- Cosine similarity uses pure Python implementation
- Warning logged: "numpy not available - using pure Python for similarity calculations"
- Slightly slower but fully functional

## Remaining Dependencies

The following are still required as they are core to the application:
- **pydantic**: Required for data validation and models
- Other Python standard library modules

## Testing

When all optional dependencies are missing:
- psutil → mock memory/CPU monitoring
- google-generativeai → mock embeddings
- numpy → pure Python calculations

The semantic processing pipeline can still be imported and used for development/testing.

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Dependencies**: Application can run with minimal external packages
2. **Development Flexibility**: Can test without API keys or heavy dependencies
3. **Resource Constraints**: Suitable for limited environments
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Features degrade gracefully rather than failing
