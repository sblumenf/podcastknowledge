# Success Criteria for Podcast Knowledge Pipeline Refactoring

## Overview

This document defines "good enough" success criteria for the modular refactoring. The goal is a functional, maintainable system for knowledge graph seeding - not perfection.

## 1. Functionality Criteria ✓

### Must Have
- [ ] **Process Test Podcasts**: System processes all 5 test transcripts without crashing
- [ ] **Create Neo4j Nodes**: Successfully creates Podcast, Episode, Segment, Entity, Insight nodes
- [ ] **Checkpoint Recovery**: Can resume processing after interruption
- [ ] **Provider Health Checks**: Basic health checks pass for all providers

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Advanced error recovery strategies
- [ ] Detailed progress reporting
- [ ] Multiple checkpoint formats

## 2. Performance Criteria ⚡

### Acceptable Thresholds
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: < 4GB for a 1-hour podcast
- [ ] **Processing Time**: < 2x slower than monolith
- [ ] **Memory Stability**: No leaks over 10 episode batch
- [ ] **Error Resilience**: Continues processing after non-critical errors

### Out of Scope
- Sub-second response times
- Real-time processing
- GPU optimization (beyond basic Whisper usage)

## 3. Code Quality Criteria 📝

### Minimum Requirements
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Each core module has at least 1 smoke test
- [ ] **Type Hints**: All public APIs have type annotations
- [ ] **Linting**: No critical errors from flake8
- [ ] **Module Size**: No module exceeds 500 lines

### Explicitly Not Required
- 100% test coverage
- Perfect type checking (mypy strict mode)
- Zero linting warnings
- Comprehensive docstrings

## 4. Maintainability Criteria 🔧

### Essential Features
- [ ] **Clear Boundaries**: Can identify which module handles what
- [ ] **Config-Driven**: Major behavior controlled by configuration
- [ ] **Provider Pattern**: Can add new LLM provider in < 100 lines
- [ ] **Basic Documentation**: README explains how to run system

### Future Enhancements
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Automated dependency updates
- Performance profiling tools
- Debug visualization

## Definition of "Done"

The refactoring is complete when:

1. **Smoke Tests Pass**: `pytest tests/test_smoke.py` succeeds
2. **Neo4j Integration Works**: Can seed a test podcast into Neo4j
3. **No Critical Bugs**: System doesn't crash on normal inputs
4. **Modular Structure**: Code organized per architecture diagram
5. **Basic CI Passes**: GitHub Actions workflow runs without errors

## Validation Checklist

Run these commands to validate success:

```bash
# 1. Install and run tests
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest tests/test_smoke.py -v

# 2. Check code quality (informational only)
flake8 src --max-line-length=88 --count --statistics
mypy src --ignore-missing-imports

# 3. Test with sample podcast (when implemented)
# python -m src.cli seed-podcast tests/fixtures/sample_podcast.json

# 4. Verify Neo4j schema (manual check)
# Connect to Neo4j Browser and run:
# CALL db.schema.visualization()
```

## Known Limitations (Acceptable)

1. **No Visualization**: All matplotlib code removed per requirements
2. **Limited Error Messages**: Basic logging only in batch mode
3. **No Interactive Features**: Pure batch processing focus
4. **Single Threading**: Initial version not optimized for concurrency
5. **Basic Provider Implementations**: Minimal viable providers

## Success Metrics Summary

| Metric | Target | Stretch Goal |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Process test podcasts | 5/5 pass | 100% pass |
| Memory usage | < 4GB | < 2GB |
| Module size | < 500 lines | < 300 lines |
| Public API type hints | 100% | 100% + generics |
| Provider health checks | Basic | Comprehensive |
| Test execution time | < 30s | < 10s |
| Neo4j operations | CRUD works | Optimized queries |

## Sign-off Criteria

- [ ] All "Must Have" functionality implemented
- [ ] Acceptable performance thresholds met
- [ ] Minimum code quality requirements satisfied
- [ ] Essential maintainability features present
- [ ] Smoke tests passing
- [ ] One successful end-to-end podcast processing
