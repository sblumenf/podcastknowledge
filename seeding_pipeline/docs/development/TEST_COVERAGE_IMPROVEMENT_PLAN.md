## Phase 2 Summary

**Test Execution Status:**

- Primary blocker: Circular import between extraction.py and extraction_factory.py

**Coverage Baseline:**
- **Overall Coverage: 7.63%** (extremely low due to import failures)
- Successfully tested modules:
  - Core configuration and models (partial coverage)
  - Basic tracing functionality
  - Some utility functions

  - Entire API layer (0%)
  - Migration modules (0%)
  - Processing pipeline (mostly 0%)
  - Seeding orchestration (mostly 0%)

**Critical Issues to Address in Phase 3:**
1. **Circular Import** (Priority 1): extraction.py ↔ extraction_factory.py
2. **Syntax Errors** (Priority 2): test_domain_diversity.py, cli.py, pipeline_executor.py
3. **Missing Dependencies** (Priority 3): Ensure all required modules installed
4. **Path Issues** (Priority 4): Fix PYTHONPATH and import paths

**Impact:**

  - Result: ⏭️ Skipped - Docker not available
- [x] Wait for containers to be healthy
  - Command: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml ps`
  - Verify all services show "healthy" or "running"
  - Result: ⏭️ Skipped - Docker not available

  - Add `@pytest.mark.requires_docker` to tests that need Docker
  - Result: ℹ️ Will need to mark integration tests when Docker is available
- [x] Create skip conditions for missing Docker
  - Add to conftest.py: `pytest.mark.skipif(not has_docker(), reason="Docker not available")`
  - Result: ℹ️ Integration tests will fail without Docker - need skip conditions
- [x] Add container cleanup in test teardown
  - Ensure containers stop after test runs
  - Result: ⏭️ Skipped - Docker not available

## Phase 3 Summary

**Accomplishments:**
- ✓ Fixed 89% of collection errors (44 → 5)
- ✓ Increased collected tests from 396 to 857 (116% increase)
- ✓ Set up test environment with mock credentials
- ✓ Verified mock providers are working (LLM mocks fully functional)
- ✓ Identified Docker dependency for integration tests

**Key Findings:**
- Docker is not available, which will impact integration tests
- Mock providers are partially working (LLM good, audio needs minor fixes)
- conftest.py already has mock fixtures for Neo4j and LLM
- Only 5 remaining collection errors (mostly missing imports)

**Next Steps:**
- Fix remaining 5 collection errors to get to 100% collection
- Run tests to establish new coverage baseline
- Focus on unit tests first since integration tests need Docker

  - Command: `coverage report | grep -E "^src/" | sort -k4 -nr`
- [ ] Verify success criteria met
  - [ ] Overall coverage >90%
  - [ ] No module <70% coverage
  - [ ] All tests passing
  - [ ] Execution time <5 minutes

### 9.2 Create Final Reports

## Execution Notes

- Run each command and document the output
- Fix issues as they arise before proceeding
- Update this plan with actual findings
- Create issues for complex problems
- Prioritize fixing failing tests over adding new ones
- Focus on high-value tests that cover critical functionality
- Use mocks to avoid external dependencies in unit tests
- Keep integration tests focused and isolated
- Document any deviations from this plan
- Save all command outputs for future reference
- Track time spent on each phase for planning improvements
