# Phase 4 Progress Report

## Date: 2025-06-06

## Status: COMPLETE

## Tasks Completed

### Task 4.1: Create Reusable VTT Test Data ✓
- Created `tests/fixtures/vtt_samples.py` with comprehensive VTT test fixtures
- Implemented helper functions:
  - `create_simple_vtt()` - generates basic single-speaker VTT files
  - `create_multi_speaker_vtt()` - creates multi-speaker conversations
  - `create_technical_discussion_vtt()` - provides technical content
  - `create_corrupted_vtt()` - generates invalid VTT for error testing
  - `create_edge_case_vtt()` - creates edge case scenarios
  - `get_sample_vtt_content()` - returns VTT content by type
  - `create_vtt_batch()` - generates multiple VTT files for batch testing
- Added VTT content constants for various test scenarios
- Included metadata dictionary for test scenario documentation

### Task 4.2: Update Mock Neo4j for VTT ✓
- Updated `tests/utils/neo4j_mocks.py` with VTT-specific query handlers
- Added support for:
  - Segment node creation
  - Speaker node creation  
  - VTTFile node creation
  - SPOKEN_BY relationships between segments and speakers
  - HAS_SEGMENT relationships between VTT files and segments
  - Timeline queries for segments within time ranges
  - Segment ordering by start_time
  - Counting queries for segments, speakers, and VTT files
- Removed RSS/podcast-specific query handlers:
  - Removed podcast lookup by name
  - Removed episode counting for podcasts
  - Removed podcast and episode creation handlers
- Enhanced relationship tracking for VTT-specific relationships

## Key Changes

1. **VTT Test Fixtures**:
   - Comprehensive set of VTT content generators
   - Support for various scenarios: simple, multi-speaker, technical, corrupted, edge cases
   - Batch creation capabilities for testing bulk processing
   - Realistic timestamps and content

2. **Neo4j Mock Updates**:
   - Full support for VTT pipeline queries
   - Timeline-based queries for segments
   - Speaker relationship management
   - Clean removal of RSS/podcast-specific code

## Validation
- Python syntax validation passed for both files
- All VTT test fixture functions properly defined
- Neo4j mock handlers cover all VTT pipeline operations
- No RSS/podcast references remain in the mock

## Next Steps
Phase 4 is complete. Ready to proceed to Phase 5: Validate Minimal Pipeline.
