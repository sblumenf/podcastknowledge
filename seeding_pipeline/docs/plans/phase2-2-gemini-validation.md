# Phase 2.2: Google Gemini Configuration Validation Report

## Summary
Gemini API configuration has been validated. The system supports both real API (when configured) and mock services for development/testing.

## Validation Steps Completed

### 1. API Key Configuration ⚠️
- GOOGLE_API_KEY not set in environment (expected for development)
- Configuration placeholder exists in .env file
- System correctly detects missing configuration

### 2. Mock Service Testing ✅
Successfully tested mock LLM service:
- Entity extraction: Working (3 entities extracted from test prompt)
- Insight extraction: Working
- Quote extraction: Working
- Mock service available in `tests.utils.external_service_mocks`

### 3. Retry Logic ✅
- Exponential backoff implementation available
- Found in `src.utils.retry.ExponentialBackoff`
- Supports configurable base and max delay

### 4. Rate Limiting ✅
Verified in `src/services/llm.py`:
- WindowedRateLimiter configured for Gemini models
- Model-specific limits:
  - gemini-2.5-flash: 10 rpm, 250k tpm, 500 rpd
  - gemini-2.0-flash: 15 rpm, 1M tpm, 1500 rpd

### 5. Error Handling ✅
LLM service includes:
- ProviderError for API failures
- RateLimitError for quota issues
- Proper exception handling

## Configuration Requirements

For production use, set in .env:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

## Test Results
- Development setup: ✅ Ready (using mocks)
- Production setup: ⚠️ Requires API key
- Error resilience: ✅ Implemented
- Rate limiting: ✅ Configured

## Recommendations
1. Continue development with mock services
2. Set up API key when ready for real data processing
3. Monitor usage to stay within free tier limits
4. Consider implementing result caching to minimize API calls

## Next Steps
Proceed to Phase 2.3: VTT Parser Validation
