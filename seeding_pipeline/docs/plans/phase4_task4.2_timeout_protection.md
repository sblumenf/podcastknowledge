# Phase 4 Task 4.2: Batch Timeout Protection Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented timeout protection for parallel processing to prevent the pipeline from hanging on unresponsive units.

## Implementation Details

### Configuration

Using existing configuration from `src/core/pipeline_config.py`:
```python
KNOWLEDGE_EXTRACTION_TIMEOUT = env_config.get_int(
    "KNOWLEDGE_EXTRACTION_TIMEOUT",
    600,  # 10 minutes per unit
    "Timeout for knowledge extraction per meaningful unit"
)
```

### Key Changes

1. **Timeout Handling in as_completed Loop**:
   - Added timeout parameter to `as_completed()` call
   - Total timeout = unit_timeout Ã— number_of_units
   - Dynamically updates remaining timeout as units complete

2. **Graceful Timeout Handling**:
   - Catches `TimeoutError` from as_completed
   - Cancels remaining futures that haven't completed
   - Logs specific timeout errors for each cancelled unit

3. **Enhanced Error Tracking**:
   - Added `timeout_errors` counter to extraction metadata
   - Separate tracking of timeout vs other errors
   - Clear logging distinguishes timeout errors

4. **Progress Preservation**:
   - Successfully completed units are preserved
   - Only unfinished units are cancelled on timeout
   - Pipeline continues if error rate < 50%

## Code Changes

### In `_extract_knowledge` method:

```python
# Get timeout from config
unit_timeout = PipelineTimeoutConfig.KNOWLEDGE_EXTRACTION_TIMEOUT

# Process with timeout
try:
    remaining_timeout = unit_timeout * len(meaningful_units)
    start_batch_time = time.time()
    
    for future in as_completed(future_to_unit, timeout=remaining_timeout):
        # Process completed futures
        # Update remaining timeout dynamically
        
except TimeoutError:
    # Log timeout
    # Cancel remaining futures
    # Track timeout errors separately
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Hanging**: Pipeline won't hang indefinitely on stuck units
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Partial results are preserved
3. **Clear Diagnostics**: Timeout errors are clearly identified
4. **Configurable**: Timeout duration can be adjusted via environment variable
5. **Fair Resource Usage**: Each unit gets equal timeout opportunity

## Configuration Options

```bash
# Default: 600 seconds (10 minutes) per unit
export KNOWLEDGE_EXTRACTION_TIMEOUT=600

# For faster testing
export KNOWLEDGE_EXTRACTION_TIMEOUT=300

# For complex episodes
export KNOWLEDGE_EXTRACTION_TIMEOUT=900
```

## Monitoring

When timeouts occur, logs will show:
```
ERROR: Knowledge extraction timed out after processing 3/5 units
WARNING: Knowledge extraction completed with 2 errors (40.0% failure rate) - 2 timeouts, 0 other errors
```

## Testing

To test timeout protection:
1. Set a very short timeout: `export KNOWLEDGE_EXTRACTION_TIMEOUT=10`
2. Process an episode with multiple units
3. Verify that timeout errors are logged and handled gracefully
4. Confirm that completed units are still saved

## Conclusion

Timeout protection is now fully implemented, ensuring the pipeline remains robust and won't hang on problematic units while preserving successfully processed data.
