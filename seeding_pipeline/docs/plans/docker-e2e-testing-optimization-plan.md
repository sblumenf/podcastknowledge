- testcontainers[neo4j]==3.7.1

### New Technologies Requiring Approval:
- **pip-tools** - For dependency optimization and requirements compilation
  - Purpose: Minimize package requirements and disk usage
  - Alternative: Manual dependency management (more error-prone)

### System Dependencies:

- **Sufficient disk space** - For container images and virtual environments

## Implementation Notes

1. **Docker Security**: Adding user to docker group provides privileged access - document security implications
2. **Environment Isolation**: Maintain separate environments for different projects while optimizing disk usage
3. **Container Lifecycle**: Implement proper container cleanup to prevent disk space accumulation
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Establish baseline metrics before and after optimizations
5. **Rollback Strategy**: Document how to revert changes if issues arise
