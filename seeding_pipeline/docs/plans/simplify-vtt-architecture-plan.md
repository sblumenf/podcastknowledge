# Simplify VTT Architecture Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan transforms the over-engineered podcast knowledge pipeline into a streamlined VTT knowledge extraction tool. The refactored system will have ~60% less code complexity while maintaining production quality. Key changes include removing the provider pattern, eliminating fixed-schema mode, consolidating duplicate components, and creating a clear, simple architecture focused solely on VTT transcript processing.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Direct service implementations replace complex provider patterns
- Single processing mode (schemaless only)
- Clear, simple CLI for VTT processing
- Consolidated codebase with no duplicate functionality
- Production-ready with focused testing

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Breaking working code**: Mitigate with incremental changes and testing
2. **Losing functionality**: Careful audit before removing code
3. **Performance regression**: Benchmark before/after changes

### Process Risks
1. **Scope creep**: Stick to simplification only, no new features
2. **Over-simplification**: Keep production quality standards
3. **Lost git history**: Use git mv when restructuring

## Implementation Notes

- Each phase builds incrementally - maintain working state
- Commit after each major task completion
- Run tests frequently to catch breaks early
- Document decisions in commit messages
- Keep a rollback plan for each phase
