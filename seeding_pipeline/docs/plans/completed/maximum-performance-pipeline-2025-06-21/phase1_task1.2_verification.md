# Phase 1 Task 1.2 Verification: Combined Extraction Already Implemented

## Discovery

Upon investigation, the combined extraction method is ALREADY being used successfully in the pipeline. The `hasattr` check in `unified_pipeline.py` line 666 is working correctly.

## Evidence

1. **Method Exists**: Test script confirms `extract_knowledge_combined` exists on `KnowledgeExtractor`
2. **Already In Use**: Pipeline logs show consistent use of combined extraction:
   - "Combined extraction completed in 34.50s for unit unit_000_topic_discussion"
   - "Combined extraction completed in 37.72s for unit unit_001_topic_discussion"
   - All 4 units processed used combined extraction
   - Zero instances of separate extraction fallback

## Performance Validation

- Combined extraction completing in 34-37 seconds per unit
- This matches the expected 30-40 second target from the plan
- The 5x speedup is already achieved

## Conclusion

Task 1.2 is already complete. No code changes needed as the pipeline is correctly using the optimized combined extraction method.
