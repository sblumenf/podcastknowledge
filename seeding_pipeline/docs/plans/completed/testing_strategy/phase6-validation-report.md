      "first_seen": "",          # âœ“ Required field  
      "error_type": "",          # âœ“ Required field
      "root_cause": "",          # âœ“ Required field
      "attempted_fixes": [],     # âœ“ Required field
      "resolution": "",          # âœ“ Required field
      "lessons_learned": "",     # âœ“ Required field
      # Plus additional metadata for enhanced tracking
  }
  ```
- âœ… **Process Document**: `failure_handling_process.md` with comprehensive workflow
- âœ… **Failure Categories**: Implemented with ErrorType enum (connection, import, assertion, etc.)
- âœ… **Priority System**: Severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low) with response guidelines

**Functional Testing**:
```bash
# Tested failure tracking functionality
failure_id = tracker.record_failure(...)  # âœ… Working
summary = tracker.generate_summary_report()  # âœ… Working
# Result: "Total failures: 1" - System operational
```

**Management Tools**:
- âœ… `scripts/manage_failures.py` - CLI tool tested and working
- âœ… Interactive failure recording and management verified
- âœ… Summary reporting functional

### âœ… Task 6.2: Implement Fix-Verify Loop
**Status**: VERIFIED COMPLETE

**Implementation Verified**:

  2. **Create minimal reproduction** - `_create_minimal_reproduction()` method âœ“
  3. **Apply fix** - Interactive fix development process âœ“
  4. **Run test in isolation** - Step 4 in verification loop âœ“
  5. **Run related test suite** - Step 5 in verification loop âœ“
  6. **Run full test suite** - Step 6 in verification loop âœ“
  7. **Document fix** - `_document_resolution()` method âœ“

**Process Flow Verified**:
```python
# Verified complete workflow in fix_verify_loop.py
def start_fix_process(self, failure_id: str):
    # Step 1: Isolate failing test âœ“
    # Step 2: Create minimal reproduction âœ“  
    # Step 3: Interactive fix development âœ“
    # Step 4-6: Verification loop âœ“
    # Step 7: Document resolution âœ“
```

**Integration Testing**:
- âœ… Integrates with failure tracking system
- âœ… Uses existing test runner infrastructure
- âœ… Interactive workflow guides user through all steps
- âœ… Script is executable and includes proper help

**Best Practices**:
- âœ… Used context7 MCP tool for debugging best practices

- âœ… Prevents regressions through comprehensive testing

### âœ… Task 6.3: Create Known Issues Documentation
**Status**: VERIFIED COMPLETE

**Implementation Verified**:
- âœ… **KNOWN_ISSUES.md Created**: Comprehensive document with proper format
- âœ… **Required Structure**: Matches plan template exactly:
  ```markdown
  # Known Issues
  
  ## Test Suite
  - Issue: [Description] âœ“
    - Impact: [What doesn't work] âœ“
    - Workaround: [If any] âœ“
    - Fix planned: [Yes/No/Future] âœ“
  ```

**Severity Levels Verified**:
- âœ… Visual severity indicators: ðŸš¨ Critical, ðŸ”´ High, ðŸŸ¡ Medium, ðŸŸ¢ Low
- âœ… Response guidelines for each severity level
- âœ… Impact descriptions and timeline information

**CI Integration Verified**:
- âœ… `.github/workflows/ci.yml` updated to check known issues on failure:
  ```bash
  # Verified CI integration exists
  python scripts/manage_known_issues.py check || true
  echo "Review KNOWN_ISSUES.md for documented limitations"
  ```

**Management Tools**:
- âœ… `scripts/manage_known_issues.py` - Tested and functional
- âœ… Can list 11 existing known issues with proper formatting
- âœ… Interactive issue addition and management

**Quarterly Review Process**:
- âœ… Review schedule documented with specific timelines:
  - Monthly during sprint planning âœ“
  - Quarterly comprehensive review âœ“
  - After major changes âœ“
  - Before releases âœ“
