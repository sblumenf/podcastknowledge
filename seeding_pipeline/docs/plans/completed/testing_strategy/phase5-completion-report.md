  - Prerequisites checking (directory structure, pytest availability)
  - Comprehensive result parsing and display
  - Test result summary with pass/fail/skip/error counts
  - Execution time tracking
  - Detailed failure reporting
  - Command-line help system

### ✅ Task 5.2: Document Test Results

- **Key Features**:
  - `test_results/` directory creation on first test run
  - Automatic result saving in timestamped JSON format (`YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_{test_type}.json`)
  - Comprehensive result data capture:
    - Timestamp and test type
    - Test counts (passed/failed/skipped/errors)
    - Execution time and performance metrics
    - Detailed failure information
    - Complete command output
  - Helper script `scripts/view_test_results.py` for result analysis
  - Result viewing capabilities: latest, all, by type, summary statistics

### ✅ Task 5.3: Create Testing Checklist
- **Status**: Complete
- **Implementation**: Created `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`
- **Key Features**:
  - Comprehensive 89-item validation checklist
  - Four major categories:
    - Environment Setup (Python, Neo4j, Configuration)
    - Core Functionality Testing (VTT processing, knowledge extraction, multi-file)
    - Test Suite Validation (infrastructure, critical tests, fixtures, E2E scenarios)
    - CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions, reporting, documentation)
  - Production readiness validation
  - Final sign-off process
  - Usage instructions and maintenance guidelines

## Technical Implementation Details

### Test Runner Framework
```python
# Command structure
./scripts/run_tests.py unit           # Run unit tests only
./scripts/run_tests.py integration    # Run integration tests only  
./scripts/run_tests.py e2e            # Run end-to-end tests only
./scripts/run_tests.py all            # Run all tests (default)

# Prerequisites checking
- Project structure validation
- pytest availability verification
- Test directory existence confirmation
```

### Result Documentation System
```python
# Automatic result saving
{
  "timestamp": "2025-05-31T12:00:00",
  "test_type": "e2e",
  "passed": 5,
  "failed": 0,
  "skipped": 1,
  "errors": 0,
  "total_time": 45.2,
  "failures": [],
  "command_output": "..."
}

# Result viewing options
./scripts/view_test_results.py              # Latest 10 results
./scripts/view_test_results.py --all        # All results
./scripts/view_test_results.py --type=e2e   # E2E results only
./scripts/view_test_results.py --summary    # Statistics summary
```

### Testing Checklist Structure
```markdown
## Environment Setup (12 items)
- Python environment, Neo4j database, configuration

## Core Functionality Testing (18 items)  
- VTT processing, knowledge extraction, multi-file processing, data integrity

## Test Suite Validation (25 items)

## File Structure Created

```
scripts/
├── run_tests.py              # Main test execution framework (executable)
├── view_test_results.py      # Test result analysis helper (executable)
└── ...

test_results/                 # Auto-created directory for result storage
└── (timestamped JSON files created during test execution)

TESTING_CHECKLIST.md          # Comprehensive validation checklist (89 items)
```

## Key Features Implemented

### Test Execution Framework
