# VTT Processing Pipeline Fix Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan will fix the broken VTT processing pipeline by connecting the CLI VTT command to the actual knowledge extraction orchestrator. Currently, the CLI only parses VTT files without performing AI-powered knowledge extraction. The fix will ensure that podcast VTT transcripts are fully processed through Gemini AI analysis and stored as structured knowledge graphs in Neo4j.

**Outcome**: A working end-to-end pipeline where `python -m src.cli.cli process-vtt` takes any podcast VTT file and produces a populated Neo4j knowledge graph with entities, relationships, and insights.

## Technology Requirements

- **No new technologies required** - using existing Gemini AI, Neo4j, and Python infrastructure
- **Documentation reference**: Use context7 MCP tool for Gemini and Neo4j API documentation

## Phase 1: Investigation and Analysis

### Task 1.1: Analyze Current VTTKnowledgeExtractor Interface
- [ ] Read and document the VTTKnowledgeExtractor class interface and methods
- **Purpose**: Understand what methods are available for processing VTT files
- **Steps**:
  1. Use context7 MCP tool to review Neo4j and Gemini documentation for integration patterns
  2. Read `/home/sergeblumenfeld/podcastknowledge/seeding_pipeline/src/seeding/orchestrator.py` completely
  3. Identify all public methods that accept VTT file inputs
  4. Document method signatures, parameters, and expected return formats
  5. Check if `process_vtt_file` method exists or needs to be created
- **Validation**: Create a markdown file documenting all available methods and their purposes

### Task 1.2: Trace Current CLI Flow
- [ ] Map the complete current execution path from CLI to final output
- **Purpose**: Understand exactly where the pipeline breaks and what components are bypassed
- **Steps**:
  1. Use context7 MCP tool for debugging best practices documentation
  2. Read CLI process_vtt function in `/home/sergeblumenfeld/podcastknowledge/seeding_pipeline/src/cli/cli.py` lines 592-740
  3. Read TranscriptIngestionManager in `/home/sergeblumenfeld/podcastknowledge/seeding_pipeline/src/seeding/transcript_ingestion.py` lines 376-443
  4. Read TranscriptIngestion.process_vtt_file method lines 180-220
  5. Document each step with input/output and identify where knowledge extraction should happen
  6. Create a flow diagram showing current vs intended execution path
- **Validation**: Flow diagram clearly shows the gap where LLM processing is missing

### Task 1.3: Identify Required Integration Points
- [ ] Determine how VTTKnowledgeExtractor should be called with VTT file data
- **Purpose**: Define the exact interface needed between CLI and orchestrator

  1. Use context7 MCP tool for method design patterns documentation
  2. Check if `process_vtt_file` method exists in VTTKnowledgeExtractor
  3. If missing, create method that:
     - Accepts file path and optional metadata
     - Uses VTTParser to parse segments
     - Calls knowledge extraction on segments
     - Returns processing results with success/failure status
  4. If exists but incomplete, modify to include full extraction pipeline
  5. Ensure method integrates with existing checkpoint system
  6. Add proper error handling and logging
- **Validation**: Method exists and can be called with VTT file path, returns detailed results

### Task 2.2: Modify CLI to Call VTTKnowledgeExtractor Directly
- [ ] Replace TranscriptIngestionManager calls with VTTKnowledgeExtractor calls
- **Purpose**: Connect CLI to the actual knowledge extraction pipeline
- **Steps**:

  2. In `/home/sergeblumenfeld/podcastknowledge/seeding_pipeline/src/cli/cli.py` around lines 682-697
  3. Replace the TranscriptIngestionManager instantiation and call
  4. Call `pipeline.process_vtt_file()` directly (or whatever method from Task 2.1)
  5. Update result handling to match new return format
  6. Ensure checkpoint integration still works
  7. Maintain all existing CLI options (parallel, skip-errors, etc.)
- **Validation**: CLI code no longer uses TranscriptIngestionManager and calls orchestrator directly

### Task 2.3: Update Result Processing and Error Handling
- [ ] Ensure CLI properly handles results from VTTKnowledgeExtractor
- **Purpose**: Maintain user-friendly CLI output while using new processing method
- **Steps**:
  1. Use context7 MCP tool for error handling patterns documentation

### Task 3.3: Add Comprehensive Logging
- [ ] Add detailed logging throughout the pipeline for debugging and monitoring
- **Purpose**: Enable troubleshooting and verify each processing step is working
- **Steps**:
  1. Use context7 MCP tool for logging best practices documentation
  2. Add DEBUG level logs in VTTKnowledgeExtractor showing:
     - VTT parsing start/completion
     - LLM API call start/completion with token counts
     - Entity extraction results summary
     - Neo4j storage operations
  3. Add INFO level logs showing processing progress milestones
  4. Add ERROR level logs with context for all failure points

  5. Verify processing takes significant time (indicating LLM calls)
  6. Check logs for LLM API calls and Neo4j operations
  7. Query Neo4j to verify nodes and relationships were created
  8. Verify content includes podcast-specific entities (Mel Robbins, daughter, etc.)
- **Validation**: Neo4j contains hundreds of nodes with podcast-specific content, processing took several minutes

### Task 4.2: Test with Additional VTT File

- **Purpose**: Maintain clean architecture and avoid confusion
- **Steps**:
  1. Use context7 MCP tool for code cleanup best practices documentation
  2. Check if TranscriptIngestionManager is used anywhere else in the codebase
  3. If unused, remove the class and its import statements
  4. If used elsewhere, add clear documentation about its limited scope
  5. Update any remaining references to use VTTKnowledgeExtractor instead
  6. Remove unused imports from CLI

2. **Content Success**: Neo4j contains appropriate entities, relationships, and insights from processed podcasts (not just file metadata)
3. **Performance Success**: Processing takes appropriate time indicating LLM analysis is occurring (several minutes for hour-long podcasts)
4. **Robustness Success**: Pipeline handles errors gracefully and provides clear feedback
5. **Architecture Success**: Clean separation between VTT parsing and knowledge extraction, with orchestrator coordinating both

## Risk Mitigation

- **Backup checkpoints** before major changes to allow rollback
- **Test with small VTT files first** before processing large transcripts
- **Monitor API quota** during testing to avoid Gemini rate limits
- **Verify Neo4j backups** before running large batch operations
