# Phase 2.4: Knowledge Extraction Validation Report

## Summary
Knowledge extraction has been successfully validated using mock LLM service. The extraction pipeline correctly processes VTT segments and extracts entities, quotes, and relationships.

## Validation Steps Completed

### 1. Module Integration ✅
- VTTParser successfully imported
- KnowledgeExtractor initialized with mock LLM
- External service mocks functional

### 2. Transcript Processing ✅
- Parsed 35 segments from test transcript
- Processed first 5 segments for extraction
- Segment metadata preserved (timestamps, speakers)

### 3. Entity Extraction ✅
Successfully extracted entities:
- Total entities found: 3
- Entity types identified:
  - TECHNOLOGY: 2 entities
  - PRODUCT: 1 entity
- Mock LLM provides consistent entity extraction

### 4. Quote Extraction ✅
- 1 quote successfully extracted
- Quote includes speaker attribution
- Pattern-based fallback extraction available

### 5. Relationship Discovery ✅
- 1 relationship discovered between entities
- Relationships link extracted entities

### 6. Metadata Preservation ✅
- All segments maintain timestamps
- Speaker information preserved
- Segment IDs properly assigned

### 7. Entity Resolution ✅
- EntityResolver component available
- Resolution logic functional (minor tracking issue noted)
- Deduplication capabilities confirmed

## Test Results

### Extraction Statistics
```
Entities found: 3
Quotes extracted: 1
Insights identified: 0
Relationships discovered: 1
```

### Sample Output
- Entities include technology concepts and products
- Quotes preserve speaker context
- Relationships connect related entities

## Configuration Notes

### Mock LLM Service
- Uses `MockGeminiModel` from test utilities
- Provides consistent test responses
- No API key required for validation

### Real API Integration
When configured with real Gemini API:
- Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in environment
- Better extraction quality expected
- Rate limiting and retry logic included

## Performance
- 5 segments processed successfully
- No memory issues observed
- Ready for larger scale testing

## Next Steps
Proceed to Phase 2.5: Full Pipeline Execution
