    NEO4J_USER: neo4j
    NEO4J_PASSWORD: password
  run: |
    pytest tests/performance -v
  continue-on-error: true  # Non-blocking initially
```

**CI Features Validated**:
- ✅ Performance test step added to workflow
- ✅ Proper environment variables configured
- ✅ Non-blocking configuration implemented (`continue-on-error: true`)
- ✅ Positioned after main tests appropriately
- ✅ Uses correct test execution command

### ✅ Threshold System

**Regression Detection**:
- **Threshold Calculation**: Automatic +20% from baseline
- **VTT Parsing**: ≤ baseline × 1.2
- **Knowledge Extraction**: ≤ baseline × 1.2  
- **Neo4j Writes**: ≤ baseline × 1.2
- **Total Pipeline**: ≤ baseline × 1.2

**Behavior Validation**:
- Tests warn (don't fail) when thresholds exceeded
- Performance status clearly reported
- Baseline missing cases handled gracefully
- Test files missing cases handled with skips

## Compatibility and Environment Testing

### ✅ Import Compatibility
- **pytest Import Handling**: Mock functions for environments without pytest
