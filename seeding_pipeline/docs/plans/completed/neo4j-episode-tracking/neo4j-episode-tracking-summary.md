# Neo4j Episode Tracking Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a Neo4j-based episode tracking system that replaces all file-based tracking mechanisms. Neo4j is now the single source of truth for tracking which episodes have been processed.

## What Was Completed

### Phase 1: Core Tracking Implementation ✅
- Created `EpisodeTracker` class in `src/tracking/episode_tracker.py`
- Defined Episode node properties for tracking without enforcing schema
- Implemented episode ID generation from VTT filenames
- Added file hash calculation for change detection

### Phase 2: Integration with Existing Components ✅
- Updated orchestrator to check Neo4j before processing episodes
- Modified orchestrator to mark episodes complete after processing
- Added `--force` flag to CLI for reprocessing completed episodes
- Created new `status` command with subcommands:
  - `status episodes`: List all episodes with status
  - `status pending`: Show unprocessed VTT files
  - `status stats`: Show aggregate statistics

### Phase 3: Remove Old Tracking Systems ✅
- Removed VTT file tracking methods from checkpoint.py
- Updated tests to use episode-level checkpoints instead of file tracking
- Modified metrics collection to query Neo4j for episode statistics
- Deprecated old checkpoint-status command

### Phase 4: Migration and Cleanup ✅
- Created migration script `scripts/migrate_to_neo4j_tracking.py`
- Updated README to reflect Neo4j-based tracking
- Created detailed documentation in `docs/neo4j-episode-tracking.md`

## Key Changes

### Files Modified:
1. **src/tracking/episode_tracker.py** - New tracking module
2. **src/seeding/orchestrator.py** - Integrated Neo4j tracking
3. **src/cli/cli.py** - Added status command, updated process-vtt
4. **src/seeding/checkpoint.py** - Removed VTT tracking methods
5. **src/utils/metrics.py** - Added Neo4j-based metrics
6. **tests/test_cli.py** - Updated for new behavior
7. **tests/integration/test_vtt_batch_processing.py** - Updated tests
8. **tests/integration/test_vtt_e2e.py** - Updated tests

### Files Created:
1. **scripts/migrate_to_neo4j_tracking.py** - Migration script
2. **docs/neo4j-episode-tracking.md** - Detailed documentation

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Eliminated sync issues between components
2. **Automatic Deletion Handling**: Deleted episodes automatically become unprocessed
3. **Better Visibility**: Easy to query episode status with Cypher
4. **Simplified Architecture**: Removed complex file-based tracking
5. **Multi-Podcast Support**: Works seamlessly with podcast-specific databases

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Check episode status
vtt-kg status episodes --podcast my_podcast
vtt-kg status pending --podcast my_podcast
vtt-kg status stats

# Process with automatic skipping
vtt-kg process-vtt --folder /path/to/vtt

# Force reprocessing
vtt-kg process-vtt --folder /path/to/vtt --force

# Migrate existing episodes
python scripts/migrate_to_neo4j_tracking.py --dry-run
python scripts/migrate_to_neo4j_tracking.py
```

## Migration Notes

For existing deployments:
1. Run the migration script to add tracking properties to existing episodes
2. Remove old checkpoint JSON files (no longer needed)
3. Update any automation scripts to use new status commands

## Technical Details

Episodes are tracked using these Neo4j properties:
- `processing_status`: 'complete' or 'failed'
- `processed_at`: DateTime of processing
- `file_hash`: MD5 hash for change detection
- `segment_count`: Number of segments processed
- `entity_count`: Number of entities extracted

The orchestrator automatically:
1. Generates episode ID from VTT filename
2. Checks Neo4j for existing episode with complete status
3. Skips if already processed (unless --force is used)
4. Marks episode complete after successful processing

## Future Considerations

- Could add more granular status tracking (e.g., 'processing', 'queued')
- Could track processing duration and other metrics in Neo4j
- Could add batch status update capabilities
- Consider adding episode processing history tracking
