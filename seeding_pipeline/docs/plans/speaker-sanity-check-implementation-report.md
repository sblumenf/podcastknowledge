# Speaker Sanity Check Implementation Report

## Summary

Successfully implemented speaker sanity check enhancements to improve data quality in the podcast knowledge extraction pipeline. The implementation follows the KISS principle for long-term maintainability.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Non-Name Filter
- Filters out transcription errors like "you know what", "um", "yeah"
- Uses simple blacklist approach
- Validates minimum length and presence of letters
- Catches multi-word lowercase phrases

### 2. Duplicate Speaker Detection
- Automatically detects likely duplicate speakers in episodes
- Handles cases like:
  - "Brief Family Member" vs "Mel Robbins' Son (Introducer)"
  - Same name with different role annotations
  - Title variations (Dr. vs full name)
- Auto-merges duplicates to canonical form

### 3. Value Contribution Check
- Validates speakers have meaningful contributions
- Checks minimum unit count (default: 2)
- Checks average text length (default: 50 chars)
- Logs warnings but keeps speakers (non-destructive)

### 4. Configuration
Added configurable thresholds to `PipelineConfig`:
- `speaker_min_name_length`: 2
- `speaker_min_units`: 2  
- `speaker_min_avg_text_length`: 50

## Integration

Enhanced the `SpeakerMapper.process_episode()` method to:
1. Run existing speaker identification methods
2. Apply sanity checks before database updates
3. Filter invalid names
4. Detect and merge duplicates
5. Check contribution value
6. Update database with validated mappings

## Testing

Created comprehensive test scripts:
1. `test_speaker_sanity_checks.py` - Integration test on real episode
2. `test_speaker_sanity_unit_tests.py` - Unit tests for each function

Test results show:
- ✓ Non-name filter correctly identifies invalid names
- ✓ Duplicate detection finds similar speakers
- ✓ Value contribution check identifies low-value speakers
- ✓ Integration works without breaking existing functionality

## Bug Fixes

Fixed incorrect `log_performance_metric` calls in `graph_storage.py` that were causing errors.

## Benefits

1. **Data Quality**: Removes invalid speaker names from database
2. **Consistency**: Auto-merges duplicate speakers
3. **Simplicity**: Rule-based approach easy to understand/maintain
4. **Safety**: Non-destructive, logs all changes
5. **Configurable**: Thresholds can be adjusted as needed

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for use. To process existing episodes:

```python
python -m src.cli process_speakers --episode-id <episode_id>
```

Or to process all episodes:

```python
python -m src.cli process_speakers --all
```

## Files Modified
