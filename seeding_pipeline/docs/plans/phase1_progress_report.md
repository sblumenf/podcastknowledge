# Phase 1 Progress Report: Remove RSS/Audio Components

## Summary
Phase 1 of the VTT-Only Pipeline Cleanup has been completed successfully. All RSS/audio-related components have been removed from the codebase.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1.1: Remove RSS/Audio Source Files ✓
- Deleted `src/api/v1/podcast_api.py` (RSS API implementation)
- No audio provider or whisper transcription files were found
- No RSS processing files were found

### Task 1.2: Clean Up Imports ✓
- Removed podcast_api imports from `src/api/v1/__init__.py`
- Updated __all__ export list to exclude RSS/podcast functions
- No whisper or audio_provider imports were found

### Task 1.3: Simplify Configuration ✓
- Removed from PipelineConfig:
  - `whisper_model_size`
  - `use_faster_whisper`
  - `audio_dir`
  - `max_episodes`
  - `max_concurrent_audio_jobs` (from SeedingConfig)
- Updated all config tests to remove assertions for deleted fields
- Fixed embedding_batch_size test assertion (was 50, now correctly 100)

## Changes Made
- 3 source files modified
- 1 source file deleted
- 1 test file extensively updated
- 4 commits made to track progress

## Remaining RSS/Audio References
While Phase 1 is complete, there are still RSS/audio references in other parts of the codebase that will be addressed in subsequent phases:
- Test files that mock RSS functionality (to be addressed in Phase 3)
- RSS-related fields in models.py (e.g., `rss_url` in Podcast model)
- CLI commands that reference RSS feeds
- Various test files that will need updating

## Next Steps
Phase 2 will focus on updating the core pipeline to remove RSS methods and simplify the VTTKnowledgeExtractor interface.
