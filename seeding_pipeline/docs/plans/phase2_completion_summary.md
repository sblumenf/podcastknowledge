# Phase 2 Completion Summary: Sentiment Analysis Fixes

## All Phase 2 Tasks Completed

### Task 2.1: Analysis ✓
- Identified the crash point at line 357 where `response_data['content']` was accessed without validation
- Documented all failure modes (None response, missing key, None content)
- Confirmed fallback mechanism quality is acceptable

### Task 2.2: Robust Error Handling ✓
- Added defensive checks:
  - `if response_data and isinstance(response_data, dict) and 'content' in response_data`
  - `if response_data['content'] is not None`
- Falls back to rule-based analysis on any parsing failure
- No more NoneType errors possible

### Task 2.3: Text-to-Number Conversion ✓
- Implemented comprehensive text-to-score mapping:
  - Common values: "high" → 0.8, "medium" → 0.5, "low" → 0.2
  - Intensity descriptors: "very" → 0.85, "somewhat" → 0.6
  - Energy/engagement specific mappings
- Added regex parsing for numeric strings:
  - Percentages: "80%" → 0.8
  - Fractions: "8/10" → 0.8
  - Decimals: "0.8" → 0.8
- Converts emotion intensities as well
- Defaults to 0.5 for unparseable values

## Result
Sentiment analysis is now robust against all types of LLM responses and will never crash the pipeline.
