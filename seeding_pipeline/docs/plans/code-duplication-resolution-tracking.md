# Code Duplication Resolution - Implementation Tracking

## Implementation Strategy

Before executing, I've analyzed the entire plan and identified key considerations:

1. **Execution Order**: Following the plan's priority (High → Medium → Low)
2. **Risk Management**: Each phase is independent; can rollback if issues arise
3. **Validation First**: Before each deletion, ensure functionality is preserved
4. **Minimal Changes**: Use simplest patterns (basic inheritance, no over-engineering)
5. **Resource Efficiency**: Keep memory footprint low for constrained environments

## Complete Task List (40 tasks across 9 phases)

### Phase 1: Metrics Consolidation (5 tasks) - HIGH PRIORITY
- [x] Task 1.1: Analyze existing metrics implementations
- [x] Task 1.2: Design unified metrics architecture
- [x] Task 1.3: Implement unified metrics module
- [x] Task 1.4: Update all metric consumers
- [x] Task 1.5: Remove old metrics modules

### Phase 2: Optional Dependencies Consolidation (4 tasks) - HIGH PRIORITY
- [x] Task 2.1: Analyze dependency handling patterns
- [x] Task 2.2: Create unified dependency handler
- [ ] Task 2.3: Migrate all dependency imports
- [ ] Task 2.4: Remove old dependency modules

### Phase 3: Embeddings Service Simplification (3 tasks) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
- [ ] Task 3.1: Review embeddings implementations
- [ ] Task 3.2: Consolidate to single embeddings service
- [ ] Task 3.3: Clean up old implementations

### Phase 4: Storage Coordination Refactoring (3 tasks) - HIGH PRIORITY
- [ ] Task 4.1: Analyze storage implementations
- [ ] Task 4.2: Create base storage classes
- [ ] Task 4.3: Refactor storage implementations

### Phase 5: Pipeline Executor Consolidation (3 tasks) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
- [ ] Task 5.1: Analyze pipeline patterns
- [ ] Task 5.2: Create pipeline base classes
- [ ] Task 5.3: Refactor pipeline executors

### Phase 6: Logging System Unification (4 tasks) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
- [ ] Task 6.1: Compare logging implementations
- [ ] Task 6.2: Create unified logging module
- [ ] Task 6.3: Update all logging imports
- [ ] Task 6.4: Remove old logging modules

### Phase 7: Resource Monitoring Centralization (4 tasks) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
- [ ] Task 7.1: Analyze resource monitoring code
- [ ] Task 7.2: Create unified resource monitor
- [ ] Task 7.3: Update resource monitoring consumers
- [ ] Task 7.4: Remove old monitoring modules

### Phase 8: Test Utilities Organization (3 tasks) - LOW PRIORITY
- [ ] Task 8.1: Identify test utilities in source
- [ ] Task 8.2: Consolidate test utilities
- [ ] Task 8.3: Update test imports

### Phase 9: Final Cleanup and Validation (4 tasks) - LOW PRIORITY
- [ ] Task 9.1: Remove common utility duplication
- [ ] Task 9.2: Run comprehensive testing
- [ ] Task 9.3: Update documentation
- [ ] Task 9.4: Final code review

## Execution Plan

### Pre-execution Checks
1. Verify git status is clean
2. Create feature branch for refactoring
3. Document current test status
4. Check for any running processes using the code

### Execution Principles
1. **Atomic Commits**: Each task gets its own commit
2. **Test After Each Phase**: Run tests to ensure nothing breaks
3. **Document Changes**: Update imports documentation as we go
4. **Preserve Functionality**: Never delete until replacement is verified
5. **Simple Patterns**: Use basic Python inheritance, no complex frameworks

### Expected Outcomes
- 15-20% reduction in code size
- Clear module organization
- Improved maintainability
- No functionality loss
- Better resource efficiency
