# Phase 1 Task 1.3 Verification: Combined Extraction Prompt Already Optimized

## Current Implementation

The `build_combined_extraction_prompt` method in `prompts.py` is already optimized for single-pass extraction.

## Prompt Structure Analysis

The prompt efficiently extracts all 5 data types:

1. **INSIGHTS** - Structured with:
   - title, description, insight_type, confidence score
   - Types: actionable, conceptual, experiential

2. **ENTITIES** - Comprehensive with:
   - 25+ entity types including medical, research, and scientific
   - importance scores, frequency counts, citation tracking
   
3. **QUOTES** - Optimized for:
   - 10-30 word segments (ideal length)
   - Speaker attribution and context
   
4. **CONVERSATION_STRUCTURE** - Provides relationships via:
   - topic_groups with key_entities (for entity relationships)
   - major_themes and conversation_flow
   - Natural boundary detection
   
5. **SENTIMENT** - Handled separately by `SentimentAnalyzer` (not in combined prompt)

## JSON Output Structure

The prompt already specifies valid JSON output format with clear structure, enabling native JSON mode parsing without cleanup.

## Conclusion

Task 1.3 is already complete. The combined extraction prompt is well-structured and optimized for efficiency. No changes needed.
