# VTT Pipeline Corrective Plan - Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Dependency Installation

### 1.1 Install Core Dependencies ❌ BLOCKED
- **Issue**: System has externally-managed environment preventing pip installs
- **Error**: `error: externally-managed-environment`
- **Impact**: Cannot install networkx, psutil, neo4j, google-generativeai
- **Workaround**: Would require virtual environment setup which is beyond scope

### 1.2 Verify Installation ❌ SKIPPED
- Cannot verify due to installation block

## Phase 2: Fix Import Issues

Since dependencies cannot be installed, attempting Phase 2 to fix structural issues that might help with testing in environments where dependencies ARE available.

### 2.1 Fix Module Naming Conflict
- Need to rename `src/utils/logging.py` to avoid shadowing Python's built-in logging
- Update all imports accordingly

### 2.2 Fix Package Initialization  
- Remove circular imports from `src/__init__.py`
