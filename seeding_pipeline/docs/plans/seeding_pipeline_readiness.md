# Readiness Criteria

## Core Functionality
- All essential data sources can be accessed and processed
- Data transformation logic correctly handles expected input formats
- Output data meets schema requirements for target systems
- Error handling captures and logs failures appropriately

## Testing Coverage
- Unit tests verify individual component behavior
- Integration tests confirm end-to-end pipeline functionality
- Edge cases (empty data, malformed inputs, etc.) are tested
- Test coverage meets minimum threshold (e.g., 80% of critical paths)

## Code Quality
- No critical bugs or data integrity issues remain
- Code follows project style guidelines and patterns
- Technical debt is documented for future improvement
- Dependencies are properly managed and up-to-date

## Documentation
- Architecture and data flow are clearly documented
- Setup and configuration instructions are complete
- API documentation covers all public interfaces
- Usage examples demonstrate common scenarios

## Performance
- Processing time meets requirements for expected data volumes
- Resource utilization (memory, CPU, network) is within acceptable limits
- Bottlenecks are identified and addressed or documented
- Monitoring is in place to track performance metrics

## Operational Readiness
- Logging provides sufficient visibility for troubleshooting
- Deployment process is documented and tested
- Rollback procedures are defined
- Maintenance tasks and schedules are documented
