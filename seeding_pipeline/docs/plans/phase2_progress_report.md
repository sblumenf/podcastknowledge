# Phase 2 Progress Report: Update Core Pipeline

## Summary
Phase 2 of the VTT-Only Pipeline Cleanup has been completed successfully. The core pipeline has been simplified to focus only on VTT processing.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 2.1: Simplify VTTKnowledgeExtractor Interface ✓
- **Status**: Already complete from previous cleanup efforts
- **Findings**:
  - No RSS-specific methods found (no `seed_podcast()` method)
  - VTT methods already present: `process_vtt_file()`, `process_vtt_files()`, `process_vtt_directory()`
  - No factory references found
  - `initialize_components()` doesn't initialize audio providers (already cleaned up)
  - Audio provider references already removed in ProviderCoordinator

### Task 2.2: Remove API v1 Compatibility Layer ✓
- **Deleted Files**:
  - `src/api/v1/seeding.py` - Removed compatibility wrapper
  - `tests/fixtures/mock_podcast_api.py` - Removed test fixture
- **Updated Files**:
  - `src/api/v1/__init__.py` - Updated to import VTTKnowledgeExtractor directly from orchestrator
- **Import Changes**: Changed from `.seeding import VTTKnowledgeExtractor` to `...seeding.orchestrator import VTTKnowledgeExtractor`

## Changes Made
- 2 files deleted
- 1 source file updated  
- 1 plan file updated
- 2 commits made to track progress

## Remaining Issues for Later Phases
The following test files still import from the deleted mock_podcast_api.py and will need updating in Phase 3:
- `tests/e2e/test_vtt_pipeline_e2e.py`
- `tests/e2e/test_e2e_scenarios.py`

## Next Steps
Phase 3 will focus on transforming the test suite to remove RSS/audio test files and update E2E tests for VTT-only processing.
