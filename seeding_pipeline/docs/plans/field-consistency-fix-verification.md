# Field Consistency Fix Verification Report

## Summary
All field consistency issues have been successfully fixed. The pipeline now uses consistent field names across all components.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Entity Fields
- **Problem**: Extraction used 'name', pipeline/storage expected 'value'
- **Solution**: Updated extraction.py to use 'value' field
- **Verification**: Created validation that checks for 'value' field

### 2. Quote Fields  
- **Problem**: Pipeline executor expected 'value' instead of 'text'
- **Solution**: Updated pipeline_executor.py to use 'text' with fallback
- **Verification**: Validation ensures quotes have 'text' field

### 3. Insight Fields
- **Problem**: Storage expected 'text', extraction created 'title/description'
- **Solution**: Added normalization to combine title/description into text
- **Verification**: Insights normalized before storage

## Validation Implementation

Created comprehensive validation functions in `src/core/validation.py`:
- `validate_entity()` - Ensures entities have 'value' and 'type'
- `validate_quote()` - Ensures quotes have 'text'
- `validate_insight()` - Ensures insights have 'title' and 'description'
- `validate_relationship()` - Ensures relationships have 'source', 'target', 'type'

## Integration Points

Added validation at two key points:
1. **After extraction** - In extraction.py after processing raw LLM output
2. **Before storage** - In unified_pipeline.py before Neo4j operations

## Error Handling

Enhanced error messages to include:
- Specific field that is missing
- Available fields in the data structure
- Full data structure for debugging

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/unit/test_field_consistency.py`:
- Tests for all validation functions
- Tests for field normalization
- Regression tests to prevent reintroduction of issues

### Integration Testing
Created verification script that confirms:
- Old entity format with 'name' is normalized to 'value'
- Quotes require 'text' field
- Insights are normalized for storage

## Next Steps to Process Failed Episodes

1. **Clear Previous Data**
   ```bash
   python3 FULL_SYSTEM_RESET.py
   ```

2. **Run Pipeline on Failed Episodes**
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

3. **Monitor Logs**
   - Look for validation warnings
   - Verify no KeyError exceptions
   - Check that all episodes complete

4. **Verify in Neo4j**
   - Confirm entities stored with proper fields
   - Check quotes and insights are stored
   - Verify relationships created

## Expected Outcome

With these fixes in place:
- Episodes that previously failed with KeyError: 'value' will process successfully
- All data structures will use consistent field names
- Validation will catch and log any future field issues
- Clear error messages will help debug any remaining issues
