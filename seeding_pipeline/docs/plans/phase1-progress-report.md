## In Progress

### Task 1.3: Install Neo4j Community Edition Locally ðŸš§

**Issue Identified**: Docker is not installed on the system.

**Installation Options**:

1. **Option A: Neo4j Desktop (Recommended)**
   - Download from: https://neo4j.com/download/
   - Free for development use
   - Includes Neo4j Browser interface
   - Easy to manage multiple databases
   - No command line setup required

2. **Option B: Install Docker first, then use Docker container**
   - Would require installing Docker on the system first
   - Then run: `docker run -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password neo4j:latest`

3. **Option C: Manual installation**
   - Download Neo4j Community Edition tar/zip
   - Extract and run manually
   - More complex setup

**Recommendation**: Since this is a hobby project and Docker is not installed, I recommend downloading Neo4j Desktop for the easiest setup experience.

## Next Steps

1. User needs to choose and install Neo4j using one of the above options
2. Once Neo4j is installed and running, we can proceed with Task 1.4: Configure Database Connection

## Notes

- All Python dependencies are successfully installed
- Virtual environment is properly configured
- Ready to proceed once Neo4j is available
