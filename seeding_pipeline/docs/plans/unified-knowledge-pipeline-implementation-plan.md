# Unified Knowledge Pipeline Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan transforms the seeding pipeline from a fragmented multi-approach system into a single, unified pipeline that processes podcast transcripts into a rich knowledge graph. The pipeline will identify speakers by name, group transcript segments into semantically meaningful units, and extract comprehensive knowledge including entities, relationships, insights, quotes, themes, complexity metrics, knowledge gaps, and missing connections. All data will be stored in Neo4j with MeaningfulUnits as the primary organizational structure, maintaining full YouTube timestamp integration and schema-less knowledge discovery.

## Success Criteria

1. **Single Pipeline**: Only one way to process VTT files - no alternative paths
2. **Speaker Identification**: Generic labels converted to actual speaker names
3. **Semantic Grouping**: Segments grouped into MeaningfulUnits based on conversation structure
4. **Complete Extraction**: All 27 entity types, 7 insight types, 6 quote types extracted
5. **Full Analysis**: Gap detection, diversity metrics, missing links analysis functional
6. **Data Integrity**: Failed processing rejects entire episode (no partial data)
7. **YouTube Integration**: Every MeaningfulUnit has accurate timestamp for video navigation
8. **Schema-less Discovery**: Dynamic entity and relationship types based on content
9. **Code Simplicity**: No over-engineering - use simplest solution that works, avoid abstractions without clear benefit

## Technology Requirements

**Existing Technologies (No Approval Needed):**
- Neo4j (existing)
- Google Gemini API (existing)
- Python async/await (existing)
- neo4j Python driver (existing)

**No New Technologies Required** - This plan uses only existing, already-integrated technologies.
