# Production-Ready Testing Fix Implementation Plan

**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS  
**Created**: 2025-01-06  
**Purpose**: Fix all testing issues to make VTT â†’ Knowledge Graph pipeline production-ready for hobby project with growth potential

## Executive Summary

This plan fixes the completely broken test suite by focusing on practical testing that ensures reliable batch processing of VTT files. We'll fix import errors, validate core functionality, and establish enough test coverage to confidently process hundreds of files without data loss. The approach is pragmatic - we fix what matters for reliable operation rather than achieving perfect coverage.

## Phase 1: Test Suite Diagnosis and Cleanup

### Task 1.1: Analyze Current Test Failures
- [x] Run pytest with verbose collection to catalog all import errors
  - Purpose: Create comprehensive list of what's broken to prioritize fixes
  - Steps:
    1. Use context7 MCP tool to review pytest collection documentation
    2. Navigate to seeding_pipeline directory
    3. Run: `pytest --collect-only -v > test_collection_errors.txt 2>&1`
    4. Create analysis file: `test_tracking/import_error_analysis.json`
    5. Categorize errors by type:
       - Missing modules (src.providers, src.factories)
       - Wrong import paths (src.processing.extraction vs src.extraction)
       - Missing classes (PodcastKnowledgePipeline vs VTTKnowledgeExtractor)
       - Syntax errors in test files
  - Validation: JSON file contains categorized list of all collection errors

### Task 1.2: Map Test Files to Current Architecture
- [x] Create mapping of test expectations vs actual code structure
  - Purpose: Understand scope of refactoring needed
  - Steps:
    1. Use context7 MCP tool to review Python AST documentation
    2. Create script: `scripts/analyze_test_imports.py`
    3. Script should:
       - Parse all test files for imports
       - Check if imported modules/classes exist
       - Map old names to new names where possible
       - Output mapping to `test_tracking/import_mapping.json`
    4. Run script on all test directories
    5. Review mapping to identify patterns
  - Validation: Mapping file shows clear oldâ†’new structure changes

### Task 1.3: Delete Obsolete Tests
- [x] Remove tests for non-existent functionality
  - Purpose: Clean slate for tests that can't be salvaged
  - Steps:
    1. Use context7 MCP tool to review git best practices for file deletion
    2. Based on import mapping, identify tests for deleted features
    3. Create list in `test_tracking/tests_to_delete.txt`
    4. For each obsolete test:
       - Git remove the file
       - Document why it was removed
    5. Commit with message: "Remove obsolete tests for deleted features"
  - Validation: No tests remain for non-existent code

### Task 1.4: Fix Import Statements in Salvageable Tests
- [x] Update all import statements to match current architecture
  - Purpose: Allow tests to at least load successfully
  - Steps:
    1. Use context7 MCP tool to review Python import system documentation
    2. Create fix script: `scripts/fix_test_imports.py`
    3. Script should apply mappings from Task 1.2:
       - `from src.providers` â†’ Remove (no replacement)
       - `from src.processing.extraction` â†’ `from src.extraction`
       - `PodcastKnowledgePipeline` â†’ `VTTKnowledgeExtractor`
       - `from cli import` â†’ `from src.cli.cli import`
    4. Run script with dry-run first
    5. Review changes, then apply
    6. Manually fix any complex cases
  - Validation: `pytest --collect-only` shows significantly fewer errors

## Phase 2: Core Functionality Test Creation

### Task 2.1: Create Minimal VTT Parser Tests

    3. Test these scenarios:
       ```python
       def test_parse_minimal_vtt():
           # Test with tests/fixtures/vtt_samples/minimal.vtt
           
       def test_parse_standard_vtt():
           # Test with tests/fixtures/vtt_samples/standard.vtt
           
       def test_handle_malformed_vtt():
           # Test with intentionally broken VTT
           
       def test_parse_empty_file():
           # Test edge case
           
       def test_parse_large_timestamps():
           # Test files > 1 hour
       ```
    4. Each test should verify:
       - Correct number of cues parsed
       - Timestamp accuracy
       - Text content preservation
       - Error handling for bad input
  - Validation: All VTT parser tests pass

       - Run full suite only if critical pass
       - Add test result summary comment
       - Cache dependencies for speed
    3. Add test categories to workflow:

- Prioritize tests that catch data loss scenarios
- Keep performance tests simple but meaningful
- Document workarounds for known issues

This plan provides a pragmatic path to production readiness for a hobby project, ensuring reliable batch processing while avoiding over-engineering.
