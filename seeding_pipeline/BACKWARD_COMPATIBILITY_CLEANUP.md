# Backward Compatibility Cleanup Report

## Summary
Since this application has never been deployed or used, all backward compatibility code has been removed to simplify the codebase.

## Files Removed
1. **src/utils/deprecation.py** - Entire deprecation utility module with decorators for marking deprecated functions/classes
2. **src/seeding/checkpoint_compatibility.py** - Checkpoint migration system for handling different checkpoint versions
3. **scripts/migrate_to_neo4j_tracking.py** - Migration script for updating existing Neo4j episodes
4. **scripts/migrate_requirements.py** - Requirements migration script
5. **tests/unit/test_deprecation.py** - Tests for deprecation utilities
6. **tests/fixtures/golden_outputs/migration_mode_golden.json** - Test fixture for migration mode

## Code Sections Removed

### 1. Logging Compatibility (src/utils/logging.py)
- Removed compatibility wrapper files: `log_utils.py` and `logging_enhanced.py`
- Renamed `unified_logging.py` to `logging.py`
- Updated 44 files to import from the new `src.utils.logging` module

### 2. Pipeline Executor Legacy Method (src/seeding/components/pipeline_executor.py)
- Removed the `process_episode()` legacy method that was kept for backward compatibility
- This method was deprecated in favor of `process_vtt_segments()`

### 3. API Version Compatibility (src/api/v1/__init__.py)
- Removed `check_api_compatibility()` function
- Removed `deprecated()` decorator function
- Removed `api_version_check()` decorator
- Simplified the module to only export version info and the main extractor

### 4. Mock Compatibility Classes (src/extraction/extraction.py)
- Note: MockEntityType and MockInsightType classes remain as they are needed for test compatibility
- These add test-specific enum values like TECHNOLOGY and OBSERVATION

## Impact
- Reduced codebase complexity
- Removed ~1,000 lines of unnecessary code
- Eliminated confusion about which methods/approaches to use
- Improved maintainability by removing code paths that would never be executed

## Recommendation
Continue to build the application without backward compatibility concerns since it has never been deployed. Focus on creating a clean, simple implementation that works well for the current requirements.
