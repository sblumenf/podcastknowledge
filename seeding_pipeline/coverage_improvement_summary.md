# Coverage Improvement Summary

## Overview
Successfully improved test coverage from **14.62%** to **20.53%** (an increase of ~6%) by adding comprehensive unit tests for high-impact modules.

## Modules with Significant Coverage Improvements

### VTT Processing
- **src/vtt/vtt_parser.py**: 0% → 97.31% coverage (144 statements)
- **src/vtt/vtt_segmentation.py**: 0% → 93.97% coverage (86 statements)

### API Modules  
- **src/api/health.py**: 0% → 93.00% coverage (94 statements)
- **src/api/app.py**: 0% → 84.34% coverage (75 statements)

### Core Processing
- **src/seeding/transcript_ingestion.py**: 0% → 98.51% coverage (159 statements)
- **src/processing/adapters/schemaless_adapter.py**: 0% → 25.81% coverage (85 statements)

### Service Modules
- **src/services/llm.py**: 15% → 81.25% coverage (64 statements)
- **src/services/embeddings_gemini.py**: 10.60% → 90.73% coverage (111 statements)

## Test Files Created
1. `tests/unit/test_vtt_parser_unit.py` - 27 tests for VTT parsing functionality
2. `tests/unit/test_vtt_segmentation_unit.py` - 23 tests for VTT segmentation
3. `tests/unit/test_api_app_unit.py` - 13 tests for FastAPI application
4. `tests/unit/test_api_health_unit.py` - 26 tests for health check endpoints
5. `tests/unit/test_transcript_ingestion_unit.py` - 36 tests for transcript ingestion
6. `tests/unit/test_schemaless_adapter_unit.py` - 20 tests for schemaless adapter
7. `tests/unit/test_llm_service_unit.py` - 20 tests for LLM service
8. `tests/unit/test_embeddings_gemini_unit.py` - 26 tests for Gemini embeddings

## Total Tests Added
191 new unit tests were created covering:
- File parsing and validation
- API endpoints and health checks
- Service integration with proper mocking
- Error handling and edge cases
- Rate limiting functionality
- Configuration management

## Test Status
- **Passed**: 170 tests
- **Failed**: 21 tests (mostly due to interface changes and import issues)
- **Errors**: 16 tests (Segment interface initialization issues in schemaless adapter)

## Next Steps to Reach 80% Coverage
To reach 80% coverage, focus on:
1. Fix failing tests (interface and import issues)
2. Add tests for remaining 0% coverage modules:
   - CLI module (350 statements)
   - Parsers module (256 statements)  
   - Batch processor (282 statements)
   - Checkpoint system (387 statements)
3. Improve coverage for partially tested modules
4. Add integration tests for end-to-end flows

## Key Achievements
- High-impact modules now have excellent coverage (>90%)
- Core VTT processing functionality is thoroughly tested
- API endpoints have comprehensive test coverage
- Service modules have proper mocking and error handling tests
