# Podcast Knowledge Graph Pipeline - Dashboard Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive Grafana monitoring dashboard solution for the Podcast Knowledge Graph Pipeline (P10.2.5). The implementation includes two main dashboards and supporting infrastructure for metrics visualization.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Main Operational Dashboard (`podcast-kg-pipeline.json`)

This dashboard provides a complete view of the pipeline's operational health:

#### Overview Section (Row 1)
- **Total Episodes Processed**: Counter showing lifetime processed episodes
- **Success Rate (5m)**: Real-time success percentage with color thresholds
- **Queue Size**: Current backlog with warning thresholds
- **Error Rate (5m)**: Failed episodes per second

#### Episode Processing (Row 2)
- **Processing Rate**: Time series showing successful vs failed episode rates
- **Processing Latency**: Percentile graph (p50, p95, p99) for performance monitoring

#### System Resources (Row 3)
- **CPU Usage**: Per-pod CPU utilization with threshold alerts
- **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption with warning/critical thresholds

#### Provider Health (Row 4)
- **API Call Rate**: Breakdown by provider showing request volume
- **Provider Latency (p95)**: 95th percentile response times
- **Provider Errors**: Table showing error types and rates
- **Service Status**: Up/down status for all monitored services

#### Processing Quality (Row 5)
- **Extraction Quality Score**: Median quality scores over time
- **Entities per Episode**: Average entity extraction metrics

#### Graph Database (Row 6)
- **Node Creation Rate**: Breakdown by node type (Person, Topic, etc.)
- **Relationship Creation Rate**: By relationship type
- **Total Nodes/Relationships**: Pie charts showing distribution

#### Queue Metrics (Row 7)
- **Queue Depth**: Historical queue size
- **Queue Wait Time**: Percentile analysis of wait times

### 2. SLO Dashboard (`podcast-kg-slo.json`)

Focused dashboard for Service Level Objective monitoring:

#### Service Level Objectives
- **24h/7d/30d Availability**: Gauge visualizations with SLO thresholds
- **Error Budget Burn Rate**: Current consumption rate

#### SLO Trends
- **Availability Trends**: Multi-window availability tracking

#### Performance SLOs
- **Episodes < 5min**: Percentage meeting latency target
- **Processing Latency Percentiles**: Detailed latency breakdown

#### Error Budget
- **Error Budget Status**: Remaining budget visualization

## Key Features

### 1. Metric Alignment
All dashboards are fully aligned with the metrics defined in `src/api/metrics.py`:
- Episode processing metrics
- Provider health metrics
- Resource utilization
- Quality scores
- Queue metrics

### 2. Alert Integration
Dashboards visualize the same metrics used in `prometheus-alerts.yml`:
- Visual thresholds match alert thresholds
- Color coding indicates alert states
- Direct correlation with alert conditions

### 3. Performance Optimization
- 30-second auto-refresh for real-time monitoring
- Efficient queries using rate() and histogram_quantile()
- Proper label filtering to reduce cardinality

### 4. User Experience
- Logical grouping with collapsible rows
- Consistent color schemes
- Meaningful panel titles and descriptions
- Time range controls for historical analysis

## Deployment

### Docker Compose Setup
```yaml
# Included in docker-compose.monitoring.yml
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana with auto-provisioning
- Alertmanager for alert handling
- Node exporter for system metrics
- Redis exporter for cache metrics
```

### Dashboard Management
- `manage-dashboards.sh` script for import/export
- JSON-based dashboard definitions
- Version control friendly

### Auto-provisioning
- Dashboards automatically loaded on Grafana startup
- Datasource pre-configured for Prometheus
- No manual configuration required

## Usage Instructions

1. **Start Monitoring Stack**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f monitoring/docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d
   ```

2. **Access Grafana**:
   - URL: http://localhost:3000
   - Default credentials: admin/admin

3. **View Dashboards**:
   - Navigate to Dashboards â†’ Browse
   - Open "Podcast Knowledge Graph" folder
   - Select desired dashboard

4. **Customize Views**:
   - Adjust time ranges using top-right selector
   - Use variables to filter by specific pods/providers
   - Create annotations for important events

## Monitoring Best Practices

1. **Regular Review**:
   - Check SLO dashboard daily
   - Review main dashboard during incidents
   - Analyze trends weekly

2. **Alert Response**:
   - Dashboard panels correlate with specific alerts
   - Use dashboards to investigate alert root causes
   - Document findings in panel annotations

3. **Capacity Planning**:
   - Monitor resource trends for scaling decisions
   - Track queue depths for throughput planning
   - Analyze provider latencies for optimization

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Dashboards**:
   - Provider-specific detailed views
   - Cost analysis dashboard
   - User experience metrics

2. **Advanced Visualizations**:
   - Heatmaps for latency distribution
   - Network graphs for relationship visualization
   - Anomaly detection overlays

3. **Integration**:
   - Links to application logs
   - Drill-down to trace analysis
   - Correlation with business metrics

This implementation provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities for the Podcast Knowledge Graph Pipeline, enabling proactive issue detection and performance optimization.
