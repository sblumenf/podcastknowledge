# Test Fixes Summary for Processing Module

## Overview
Fixed the most common issues in the processing module tests, reducing failures from 55 to ~52.

## Main Issues Fixed

### 1. EntityType Enum Issues
**Problem**: Tests were using `EntityType.SCIENTIFIC_THEORY` which doesn't exist.
**Fix**: Replaced with `EntityType.CONCEPT` in:
- `test_complexity_analysis.py`
- `test_metrics.py`

### 2. ComplexityLevel Enum Issues
**Problem**: Tests were using enum values from `extraction_interface.py` (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) instead of `models.py` values (LAYPERSON, INTERMEDIATE, EXPERT).
**Fix**: Updated all ComplexityLevel references to use correct enum values.

### 3. Data Model Mismatches
**Problem**: Tests expected different field names than what the models provide.
**Fix**: Updated test data structures:
- Entity: Added `id`, changed `type` to `entity_type`, `confidence` to `confidence_score`
- Insight: Added `id`, `title`, `description`, changed structure completely
- Quote: Added `id`, changed `timestamp` format, `type` to `quote_type`

### 4. Prompt Test Updates
**Problem**: Tests were checking for exact prompt text that has changed.
**Fix**: Made assertions more flexible, checking for key concepts rather than exact text.

### 5. VTT Extraction Method Signatures
**Problem**: `extract_quotes` method wasn't handling the test's input format.
**Fix**: Added proper `extract_quotes` method that handles both string and list inputs.

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Import Errors (35 ERROR tests)
Many tests are failing at setup due to missing imports or circular dependencies:
- EntityResolver tests
- EpisodeFlowAnalyzer tests
- ImportanceScorer tests
- TextPreprocessor tests
- VectorEntityMatcher tests

### 2. Parser Tests (~20 failures)
The `test_parsers.py` tests are failing because the ResponseParser class doesn't exist or has different methods.

### 3. Method Signature Mismatches
Some tests expect methods that don't exist or have different signatures:
- `test_extraction.py` failures related to quote extraction
- `test_metrics.py` failures related to complexity calculations

### 4. Test Expectation Issues
Some tests have unrealistic expectations:
- Technical density thresholds too high
- Complexity classifications not matching actual behavior

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Import Issues First**: The 35 ERROR tests need import paths fixed or missing classes implemented.

2. **Update Parser Tests**: Either implement the ResponseParser class or update tests to use existing functionality.

3. **Review Test Expectations**: Some tests may need their assertions updated to match realistic values.

4. **Consider Test Deletion**: Some tests may be testing functionality that no longer exists and should be removed.

## Files Modified
- `/tests/processing/test_complexity_analysis.py`
- `/tests/processing/test_metrics.py`
- `/tests/processing/test_prompts.py`
- `/tests/processing/test_vtt_extraction.py`
- `/src/extraction/extraction.py` (added `extract_quotes` method)

## Next Steps
1. Address import errors in the ERROR tests
2. Fix or remove parser tests
3. Update remaining test expectations
4. Run full test suite to verify fixes
