## Notes for Implementation

1. **Always preserve functionality first** - if unsure, don't change it
2. **Test after every change** - run relevant tests frequently
3. **Commit often** - small, focused commits are easier to revert
4. **Document decisions** - explain why changes were made
5. **Ask for clarification** - when requirements are unclear
6. **Measure performance** - before and after each phase
7. **Keep backward compatibility** - unless explicitly approved to break it

This plan prioritizes safety and functionality preservation while achieving the refactoring goals. Each checkbox represents a concrete, testable action that maintains system behavior while improving code quality.
