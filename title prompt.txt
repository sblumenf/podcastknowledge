Your goal is to come up with a title for the following insight based off the transcript you've been given.

You want the title to be short, but specific. The user should be able to look at the title and understand what the insight is about.

Guidelines:
- A generic title is the enemy. Use the unique verbiage of the insight to form the title.
- Don't include 'the' in the title. For example, 'The Importance of Being Early' should just be 'Importance of Being Early'.
- Speak in active voice. For example, 'Importance of Being Early' should be 'Being Early Is Important'.
- Do not use adverbs. For example, 'Wealth Often Precedes Enjoyable Work' should be 'Wealth Precedes Enjoyable Work'. or 'Seamless Waymo Self-Driving Experience in San Francisco' should be 'Waymo in SF'
- Wrap your title in <title> tags. Ex: <title>Employees Show Greatness Early</title>
