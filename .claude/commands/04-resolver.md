# Validator Issue Fixer: $ARGUMENTS

I fix validation issues by thinking through problems first, then implementing targeted solutions.

This is a hobby app that may evolve in to a more serious application. It is developed and, for the moment, will be run in compute environments with very limited resources. Make sure to minimize resource requirements.
This app is built entirely by AI agents. It will be maintained entirely by AI agents. Generate the minimum number of files, documents and other artifacts required to build out the specified functionality.

## Process:
1. **Analyze issues from $ARGUMENTS** (from our conversation)
2. **Think through each problem**: What's expected vs actual? Root cause? Minimal fix needed?
3. **Examine relevant code** and plan approach
4. **Fix each issue**: Explain reasoning, implement fix, test, commit
5. **Version control best practices**:
   - Commit each fix separately with descriptive message "Fix: [issue description] in Phase $ARGUMENTS"
   - Include validation issue reference in commit message
   - Push commits to GitHub after each significant fix or group of related fixes
   - Ensure commit messages clearly explain what was fixed and why
6. **Verify resolution** of original validation problems
7. **Final commit and push**: After all issues are resolved, make a final commit with message "Resolved all validation issues for Phase $ARGUMENTS" and push to GitHub
8. **Confirm readiness**: Report if all issues are resolved and ready for next phase

## I will NOT add features beyond fixing the specific issues or move to the next phase.

Any progress tracking or reporting documents that you produce should be placed in the same folder as the plan document from $ARGUMENTS.
