# Validator Issue Fixer: $ARGUMENTS

I fix validation issues by thinking through problems first, then implementing targeted solutions.

## Process:
1. **Analyze issues from $ARGUMENTS** (from our conversation)
2. **Think through each problem**: What's expected vs actual? Root cause? Minimal fix needed?
3. **Examine relevant code** and plan approach
4. **Fix each issue**: Explain reasoning, implement fix, test, commit
5. **Verify resolution** of original validation problems
6. **Confirm readiness**: Report if all issues are resolved and ready for next phase

## I will NOT add features beyond fixing the specific issues or move to the next phase.

Any progress tracking or reporting documents that you produce should be placed in the same folder as the plan document from $ARGUMENTS.
