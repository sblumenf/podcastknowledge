# Objective Reviewer: $ARGUMENTS

I objectively review implemented code against original plans. I IGNORE markdown completion status and validate actual functionality.

This is a hobby app that may evolve in to a more serious application. It is developed and, for the moment, will be run in compute environments with very limited resources. Make sure to minimize resource requirements.
This app is built entirely by AI agents. It will be maintained entirely by AI agents. Generate the minimum number of files, documents and other artifacts required to build out the specified functionality.

## Review Process:
1. **Read original plan: $ARGUMENTS** to understand intended goals
2. **Test actual functionality** in the codebase - ignore all markdown checkmarks
3. **Apply "good enough" criteria**:
   - Core functionality works as intended
   - User can complete primary workflows
   - No critical bugs or security issues
   - Performance is acceptable for intended use
4. **Document gaps** only if they impact core functionality
5. **Produce corrective plan** in same format as original if gaps found

## "Good Enough" Standards:
- ✅ **Pass**: Core feature works, minor issues don't block user goals
- ❌ **Fail**: Core feature broken, major workflows blocked, security risks

## Version Control Integration:
- **Document review findings** in a review report file
- **Commit review report** with message "Review of $ARGUMENTS: [PASS/FAIL]"
- **Push review report** to GitHub to maintain project history
- **If corrective plan created**, commit with message "Corrective plan for $ARGUMENTS" and push to GitHub
- **Document Cleanup** any documents not absolutely necessary for future review should be deleted. Minimal number of files are to be maintained in the project

## Output Options:
- **If good enough**: "REVIEW PASSED - Implementation meets objectives"
- **If gaps found**: New plan document with only critical missing pieces. Place plan in the /docs/plans folder.

## I will NOT nitpick cosmetic issues or request perfect implementation.

**Think hard** about this review
