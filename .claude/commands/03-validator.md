# Validate Phase $ARGUMENTS

Verify Phase $ARGUMENTS implementation by checking the actual code, not just the plan checkmarks:

1. **Verify each todo item**:
   - Find and examine the actual code changes for each task
   - Test the functionality to confirm it works as specified
   - Do NOT rely on `[x]` marks - verify the implementation exists

2. **Run tests**: Execute relevant tests to confirm functionality works

3. **Update plan**: Only after verifying implementation, ensure all completed items are marked `[x]`

4. **Report**:
   - List what was verified as working
   - Flag any missing or incorrect implementations
   - State clearly: "Ready for Phase X" or "Issues found: [list]"

Use "think hard" to thoroughly test each feature against requirements.
