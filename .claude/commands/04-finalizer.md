# Complete Plan: $ARGUMENTS

Validate full implementation and complete the plan: $ARGUMENTS

1. **Functional validation** (DO NOT rely on checkbox status):
   - Test every feature described in the plan
   - Verify actual functionality matches specifications
   - Run comprehensive tests across all implemented components
   - Check integration between all phases

2. **Success criteria verification**:
   - Test each success criterion against the live implementation
   - Document which criteria pass/fail with evidence
   - Ensure measurable outcomes are actually achieved

3. **Comprehensive review using "ultrathink"**:
   - Verify the complete system works as intended
   - Check for any missing functionality
   - Confirm all plan objectives are met in practice

4. **Plan completion**:
   - Only if ALL functionality is verified working:
     - Move plan from `docs/plans/` to `docs/plans/completed/`
     - Add completion date to the plan document
   - If issues found, list them and keep plan in active folder

5. **Final confirmation**:
   Provide plain English summary:
   - "The [plan name] has been successfully completed. The system now [describe what works]."
   - OR "The plan cannot be marked complete. Missing: [list issues]."
