# Implement Phase $ARGUMENTS

Implement Phase $ARGUMENTS from the provided implementation plan:

1. **For each todo item in Phase $ARGUMENTS**:
   - Consult context7 MCP tool for relevant documentation before implementing
   - Implement the feature/change described
   - Mark the todo item as complete (e.g., `- [x] Task description`)
   - Commit changes after each significant step

2. **No deviation**: Implement exactly what's specified in the plan. Do not add extra features or optimizations not explicitly mentioned.

3. **Technology constraints**: Do not introduce new technologies (databases, frameworks, models, libraries, etc.) unless explicitly specified in the plan. Use only existing project dependencies.

4. **Work autonomously**: Solve problems as they arise using "think hard" or "ultrathink" for complex decisions

5. **Sequential execution**: Complete todo items in order

6. **Summary**: After all todos are implemented and marked complete, provide a summary of what was accomplished.

Any progress tracking or reporting documents that you produce should be placed in the same folder as the plan document from $ARGUMENTS.
