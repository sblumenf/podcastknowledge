# Implement Phase $ARGUMENTS

Implement Phase $ARGUMENTS from the provided implementation plan:

This is a hobby app that may evolve in to a more serious application. It is developed and, for the moment, will be run in compute environments with very limited resources. Make sure to minimize resource requirements.
This app is built entirely by AI agents. It will be maintained entirely by AI agents. Generate the minimum number of files, documents and other artifacts required to build out the specified functionality.

1. **For each todo item in Phase $ARGUMENTS**:
   - Consult context7 MCP tool for relevant documentation before implementing
   - Implement the feature/change described
   - Mark the todo item as complete (e.g., `- [x] Task description`)
   - Commit changes after each significant step
   - Push changes to GitHub after each commit with a descriptive message

2. **No deviation**: Implement exactly what's specified in the plan. Do not add extra features or optimizations not explicitly mentioned.

3. **Technology constraints**: Do not introduce new technologies (databases, frameworks, models, libraries, etc.) unless explicitly specified in the plan. Use only existing project dependencies.

4. **Work autonomously**: Solve problems as they arise using "think hard" or "ultrathink" for complex decisions

5. **Sequential execution**: Complete todo items in order

6. **Version control**: After completing all items in the phase:
   - Ensure all changes are committed with descriptive messages
   - Push all commits to the appropriate GitHub branch
   - Include the phase number in commit messages (e.g., "Phase $ARGUMENTS: Implement feature X")

7. **Summary**: After all todos are implemented and marked complete, provide a summary of what was accomplished.

Any progress tracking or reporting documents that you produce should be placed in the same folder as the plan document from $ARGUMENTS.
