# Complete Plan: $ARGUMENTS

Validate full implementation and complete the plan: $ARGUMENTS

This is a hobby app that may evolve in to a more serious application. It is developed and, for the moment, will be run in compute environments with very limited resources. Make sure to minimize resource requirements.
This app is built entirely by AI agents. It will be maintained entirely by AI agents. Generate the minimum number of files, documents and other artifacts required to build out the specified functionality.

1. **Functional validation** (DO NOT rely on checkbox status):
   - Test every feature described in the plan
   - Verify actual functionality matches specifications
   - Run comprehensive tests across all implemented components
   - Check integration between all phases

2. **Success criteria verification**:
   - Test each success criterion against the live implementation
   - Document which criteria pass/fail with evidence
   - Ensure measurable outcomes are actually achieved

3. **Comprehensive review using "ultrathink"**:
   - Verify the complete system works as intended
   - Check for any missing functionality
   - Confirm all plan objectives are met in practice

4. **Plan completion**:
   - Only if ALL functionality is verified working:
     - Move plan and any associated markdown files from `docs/plans/` to a new, appropriately titled folder under `docs/plans/completed/`
     - Make sure that any temporary markdown files that are not required for future review are deleted
     - Add completion date to the plan document
   - If issues found, list them and keep plan in active folder

5. **Version control finalization**:
   - Commit all final changes with message "Finalize implementation of $ARGUMENTS"
   - Include summary of completed work in commit message
   - Push all changes to GitHub - make sure to include a reference to to the parent folder to the docs/plans folder as well as the plan name in the commit message for ease of reference
   - Create a tag for the completed milestone if appropriate (e.g., "v1.0-$ARGUMENTS-complete")

6. **Final confirmation**:
   Provide plain English summary:
   - "The [plan name] has been successfully completed. The system now [describe what works]."
   - OR "The plan cannot be marked complete. Missing: [list issues]."
