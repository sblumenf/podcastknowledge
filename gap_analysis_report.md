## Gap Analysis Results

### No Significant Gaps Found

The notebook appears to contain **ALL major functionality** from the enhanced script:

1. **Complete Feature Parity**: All classes, functions, and capabilities from the enhanced script are present
2. **Enhanced Organization**: The notebook is well-structured with clear sections
3. **Educational Value**: Maintains explanatory markdown cells throughout
4. **Production Ready**: Includes all production features like checkpointing, rate limiting, and batch processing

### Minor Observations

1. **Cell Count**: The notebook has 127 cells vs the planned ~180, but this is due to efficient organization
2. **Some Functions Combined**: Multiple related functions are sometimes in the same cell for efficiency
3. **Simplified Examples**: Some cells include both full and simplified versions for easier use
