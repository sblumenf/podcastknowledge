00:59:10 Sam Parr: so I mean you you you definitely do and you definitely can I think that you will eventually for sure

00:59:10 Steph Smith: someone by the way I read the comments and I read one from something one of the episodes I was on ages ago and someone wrote something like wow steph
00:59:30 Steph Smith: has a really intense case of imposter syndrome and I was like oh true anyway I guess if people wanna find

00:59:30 Sam Parr: by the way I'll tell you this now you do I remember when I was negotiating your salary when you first joined and you asked for a number I don't
00:59:30 Sam Parr: remember if I did this for you it we in particular women would typically do this they would say a number and I would say a number back or I
00:59:30 Sam Parr: would just say a number to them and they would just accept it and I'll be like hey you should negotiate with me women in particular were horrible at pushing
00:59:30 Sam Parr: back on their salary for what they should ask for and you know my company was small we in aggregate probably hired 75 people but I noticed a small trend
00:59:30 Sam Parr: of women in particular did not push back nearly as hard as the men there were many men that they would push back and it was laughable what they I'm
00:59:30 Sam Parr: like there's not a chance I'm going to give you this but I guess I'll meet you somewhere in the middle to like adjust this but like this is crazy
00:59:30 Sam Parr: I offered I was thinking you are a $150,000 a year person dressed for 700,000 like that's just ridiculous but I remember with you steph you were way we gave
00:59:30 Sam Parr: you a lot of bumps I think over the how long you worked with us but you you started way too low and I would encourage you to maybe not
00:59:30 Sam Parr: for this product but to definitely elevate what you should be demanding for pay I think you're doing alright now at a 16 c but that I've noticed that with
01:00:51 Sam Parr: you in particular amongst very very very smart and qualified young women

01:00:51 Steph Smith: yeah it took me around what is it so 21 to 28 when I 28 or 29 when I joined a 16 z so it took me like 7 years
01:01:05 Steph Smith: or so to actually learn to negotiate so I agree

01:01:05 Shaan Puri: can I tell you of embarrassing version of impostor syndrome that I have which is it's not impostor syndrome but it is what I call michael Scott syndrome where sometimes
01:01:05 Shaan Puri: then I felt this for like 10 years I always hire people that are like super smart that's great upfront but the downside is sometimes you just feel like michael
01:01:05 Shaan Puri: Scott you're like oh I'm the idiot in the office and I'm telling these people I'm actually in their way these people are like they're kinda looking at me like
01:01:05 Shaan Puri: the way that jim halpert looks at you know michael Scott and I'm like oh no it's happening that's the the the michael Scott thing is happening have you ever
01:01:41 Shaan Puri: felt that

01:01:41 Sam Parr: yes I felt that way all the time and then I realized that's actually I felt that way for a long time and then I realized oh wait no that
01:01:51 Sam Parr: just means I'm good at hiring so like I should just get out of the way

01:01:57 Shaan Puri: what Scott would do he turned into a compliment for himself

01:01:57 Sam Parr: no I felt that way too I remember hiring people that were a older than me and b smarter and I'm like what the fuck are these people did I
01:02:11 Sam Parr: really just convince this person did I just trick this person into coming and joining anything I'm doing I feel horrible about that

00:39:24 Steph Smith: this was forever ago I wonder what it is now but back then it was like early on in the airpod journey and it was like airpods if it was
00:39:37 Steph Smith: a stand alone company would be in the fortune 50 or something like that and I was like woah woah

00:39:44 Sam Parr: I think your stat was like airpods make more revenue than like spotify snapchat and airbnb combined yeah

00:39:44 Steph Smith: I think twitter was on that too it was yeah and that was again that was in 20 I wanna say 2019 or 2020 and so now there's some crazy
00:39:44 Steph Smith: stats with airpods which is just like 70% of all us teens have airpods like that is like true penetration and so early on in that trend it's like okay
00:39:44 Steph Smith: there's like cases there's I'm trying to remember like key chains really simple stuff but I think what is worth just understanding or or what you can take away from
00:39:44 Steph Smith: this gadget flow website is like okay what are the newest devices that are not gonna have the scale of like 100 or 1000 of people using them but millions
00:40:30 Steph Smith: or 100 of millions and what are the adjacent accessories or products that I can create

00:40:33 Sam Parr: so how do you how do you use gadget flow

00:40:33 Steph Smith: so gadget flow is not as much of like you know a searchable database like something like jungle scout but it's more so just what I would do if I
00:40:33 Steph Smith: came to this page is first I would look at the drop down of most popular right so that's where you're gonna see some of those big devices and then
00:40:33 Steph Smith: the other takeaway is some of the drop down categories I think so the one that caught my eye was pet accessories so remember gadget flow is like all tech
00:40:33 Steph Smith: devices and so if you go to pet accessories there's a bunch of different things I guess you both have owned dogs I've never owned a owned a dog but
00:41:20 Steph Smith: I wonder if you're familiar with any of these devices and in particular there was one that I noticed have you guys heard of fluent pet

00:41:21 Sam Parr: no what's that

00:41:22 Shaan Puri: no what is it

00:41:22 Steph Smith: it is this really interesting trend of these buttons fluent pet is a particular brand that I think is going pretty viral because of one account this dog called I
00:41:22 Steph Smith: am bunny this this account has I think a 1000000 followers on instagram and it's it's basically these buttons where you can I don't know how like how well this
00:41:52 Steph Smith: works for all dogs but you can kind of teach them to communicate with you by pushing these buttons to indicate what they want

00:41:52 Sam Parr: and I've seen these and and it's and and it is actually really cool so the way it looks is it looks like a so it looks like a imagine
00:41:52 Sam Parr: like a like a twister pad and each color has a button on it and the one button means bathroom one button means food one button means other thing and
00:42:15 Sam Parr: you could train your dog to click a button to do what to tell you what they want it it's actually really

00:42:16 Shaan Puri: cool

00:42:16 Sam Parr: yeah it's pretty awesome I've seen these and I
