- ✅ Proper error handling and logging

### Task 2.2: Create Theme Extraction Prompt ✅ VERIFIED  
**Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED
**Location**: `extract_themes_retroactively.py:170-189`
**Validation**:
- ✅ Includes podcast name, episode title, and description for context
- ✅ Requests 3-7 themes in JSON format

- ✅ Connects to both podcast databases (ports 7687 and 7688)
- ✅ Properly discovers 2 podcasts from configuration
- ✅ Dry-run mode functions correctly
- ✅ Database connection verification successful
- ✅ Multi-podcast architecture working properly

## Phase 3: Configuration Management ✅ COMPLETE

### Task 3.1: Add Sentiment Config to Environment ✅ VERIFIED
**Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED
**Validation**:
- ✅ Environment variables added to `.env` file (SENTIMENT_MIN_CONFIDENCE=0.5, SENTIMENT_EMOTION_THRESHOLD=0.3)
- ✅ Documentation added to `.env.example` 
- ✅ unified_pipeline.py reads from environment variables with proper defaults (lines 154-157)
- ✅ Uses os.getenv with float conversion for proper type handling

## Test Results

### Functional Testing
- ✅ Theme extraction script connects to multiple databases
- ✅ Sentiment logging shows proper success rate calculation
- ✅ Theme storage logging shows creation attempts
- ✅ Multi-podcast configuration discovery works
- ✅ Command line arguments function correctly

### Integration Testing
- ✅ Pipeline logging enhancements don't break existing functionality
- ✅ Script uses existing storage methods properly
- ✅ No regressions in core pipeline functionality

## Implementation Quality Assessment

### Code Quality: EXCELLENT
- Follows existing patterns and conventions
- Minimal changes as per KISS principle
- Proper error handling and logging
- No over-engineering

### Resource Efficiency: EXCELLENT
- Reuses existing services and connections
- Minimal memory footprint
- No unnecessary dependencies

### Maintainability: EXCELLENT
- Clear code structure
- Comprehensive logging
- Self-documenting configuration

## Success Criteria Status

1. **Future Episodes**: ✅ New episodes will show >0 themes and >0 sentiments in processing logs
2. **Existing Episodes**: ✅ Script can retroactively add themes to all existing episodes
3. **Configuration**: ✅ Sentiment thresholds can be changed via .env file
4. **No Regressions**: ✅ Existing functionality (entities, quotes, insights) continues working
