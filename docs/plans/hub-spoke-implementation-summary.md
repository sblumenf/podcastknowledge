# Hub-Spoke Cluster Visualization Implementation Summary

## Completed Implementation (Phases 1-4)

### Phase 1: Backend API Enhancement ✅
- Created `/api/podcasts/{podcast_id}/clusters/{cluster_id}/meaningful-units` endpoint
- Added centroid vectors to cluster response data
- Implemented logarithmic scaling for edge weights (normalized 0-1)

### Phase 2: Frontend Visualization Updates ✅
- Added TypeScript types for MeaningfulUnit with sentiment properties
- Implemented React state management for selected cluster and spoke units
- Created click handler using `useRegisterEvents` for cluster selection
- Implemented sentiment-based color mapping (green/red/gray)
- Added circular spoke layout calculation around clusters
- Integrated API calls to fetch top K meaningful units

### Phase 3: User Interface Controls ✅
- Added slider control for adjusting spoke count (3-20) with localStorage persistence
- Implemented show/hide toggle for all spokes
- Created sentiment color legend showing positive/neutral/negative indicators
- Added responsive CSS styling for all controls

### Phase 4: Performance Optimizations ✅
- Implemented client-side caching with 15-minute expiration and 50-entry limit
- Optimized node operations with batch addition/removal
- Added loading spinner when fetching meaningful units
- Prevented concurrent requests for same cluster

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Interactive Hub-Spoke Visualization**
   - Click any cluster to reveal its top 10 most representative MeaningfulUnits
   - Units are arranged in a circle around the cluster
   - Sentiment coloring provides immediate visual feedback

2. **User Controls**
   - Adjustable spoke count (3-20 units)
   - Toggle to show/hide all spokes
   - Sentiment color legend

3. **Performance**
   - Caching reduces redundant API calls
   - Batch operations improve rendering performance
   - Loading states provide user feedback

## Remaining Tasks (Phase 5)

### Task 5.1: Add Unit Tests
- Test sentiment color mapping functions
- Test spoke position calculations
- Test caching logic

### Task 5.2: Performance Testing
- Test with 50+ clusters
- Measure frame rates during interactions
- Profile memory usage

### Task 5.3: Accessibility Review
- Add ARIA labels
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Provide alternative visual encodings for color-blind users

## Usage Instructions

1. **View Clusters**: The main view shows all clusters with connections
2. **Explore Details**: Click any cluster to see its top meaningful units
3. **Adjust Display**: Use the slider to change the number of spokes shown
4. **Toggle Spokes**: Use the checkbox to hide/show all spokes
5. **Understand Sentiment**: Green = positive, Gray = neutral, Red = negative

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Sigma.js
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Neo4j
- **Caching**: Map-based with timestamp expiration
- **Layout**: ForceAtlas2 for clusters, circular for spokes
