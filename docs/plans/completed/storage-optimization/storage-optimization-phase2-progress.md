# Storage Optimization Phase 2 - Completion Report

## Phase 2: Clean Temporary and Log Files - COMPLETED ✓

### Summary
Successfully completed all Phase 2 tasks, achieving storage reduction of approximately 6.75 MB through cleaning temporary files and archiving logs.

### Tasks Completed

#### Task 2.1: Remove Empty Temporary Files ✓
- **Action**: Cleaned all temporary files
  - Removed 42 empty .tmp files from `/transcriber/data/checkpoints/`
  - Verified no .tmp files remain in project
- **Result**: Clutter removed, cleaner project structure

#### Task 2.2: Archive and Remove Large Logs ✓
- **Action**: Handled oversized log files
  - Archived with gzip:
    - `podcast_transcriber_20250531.log` → `.gz` (192K → 10.6K)
    - `podcast_transcriber_20250601.log` → `.gz` (675K → 34.2K)
    - `podcast_transcriber_20250602.log` → `.gz` (524K → 29.8K)
    - `podcast_transcriber_20250603.log` → `.gz` (5.0M → 212K)
  - Removed error logs:
    - `errors_20250531.log` (24K)
    - `errors_20250601.log` (61K)
    - `errors_20250602.log` (64K)
    - `errors_20250603.log` (197K)
  - .gitkeep already present in logs directory
- **Result**: Log directory reduced from 6.7MB to 288KB

### Storage Impact
- **Phase 2 Reduction**: ~6.75 MB
- **Cumulative Reduction**: ~1.005 GB (Phase 1 + Phase 2)
- **Current Project Size**: ~68 MB (estimated)

### Validation
- All .tmp files verified as removed
- Log files successfully archived with gzip
- Error logs deleted
- Directory structure maintained with .gitkeep

### Next Steps
Ready to proceed with Phase 3: Consolidate Test Artifacts

### Notes
- Log archiving preserved recent logs while reducing storage
- Gzip compression achieved excellent ratios (95%+ reduction)
- No issues encountered during implementation
