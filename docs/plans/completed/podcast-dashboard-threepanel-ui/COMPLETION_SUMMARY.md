## 🔧 Outstanding Backend Issues

Two backend configuration issues remain outside the scope of this frontend implementation:

1. **Episodes API 404**: Backend endpoint needs route registration fix
2. **Chat GraphRAG Parameter**: Backend service configuration mismatch

These issues do not affect the quality or completeness of the frontend implementation.
