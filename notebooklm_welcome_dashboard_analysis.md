   - Background: Clean white (#FFFFFF) with light gray accents (#F8F8FA)
   - Text: High contrast black and dark gray for optimal readability
   - Interactive elements: Blue hover states and subtle shadows

2. **Typography**
   - Font Family: Google Sans and Google Sans Text
   - Hierarchy: Clear size differentiation (14px body, 16px subheads, 20px+ headers)
   - Weight variations: 400 (regular), 500 (medium), 700 (bold)

4. **Context Menu**: Delete, rename, share options

### Known Issues

Users have reported several card-related issues:
- Automatic title generation lacking (many "Untitled" notebooks)
- Emoji alignment problems in card headers
- Inconsistent padding between elements
- No visual distinction between notebook types

## First-Time User Experience

### Onboarding Strategy

NotebookLM employs a "learning by doing" approach:

1. **Immediate Value Demonstration**
   - Giant "New Notebook" button as primary action
   - Example notebooks showcasing capabilities
   - No lengthy tutorials or walkthroughs

2. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Features revealed as users explore
   - Contextual help appears when needed
   - Notebook Guide appears after first source upload

3. **Suggested First Actions**
   - Upload 10 recent documents to test functionality
   - Explore example notebooks for inspiration
   - Start with familiar content for comfort

### Empty State Design

For new users with no notebooks:
- **Primary Message**: Welcome text explaining product value
- **Clear CTA**: Prominent "New Notebook" button
- **Educational Content**: Example notebooks grid
- **Secondary Actions**: Links to help documentation

### Onboarding Best Practices Observed

1. **Minimal Friction**: No complex setup required
2. **Immediate Engagement**: Users can start within seconds
3. **Contextual Learning**: Features explained when relevant
4. **Value First**: Focus on what users can achieve

## Navigation Patterns
