# Type Hints Report - Phase 3

## Summary

Added type hints to critical modules to improve code maintainability and catch potential type errors.

## Type Hints Added:

### Critical Modules (mypy compliant with strict settings):
1. **src/utils/progress.py**
   - Added return type annotations for all methods
   - Added type hints for generic iterator function
   - Fixed missing type annotations

2. **src/vtt_generator.py**
   - Added type annotation for list variable
   - Added return type annotation for _save_vtt_file method

3. **src/speaker_identifier.py**
   - Added type annotation for samples dictionary
   - Module already had comprehensive type hints

4. **src/transcription_processor.py**
   - Added type annotations for list variables
   - Module already had good type coverage

5. **src/feed_parser.py**
   - Added return type annotation for __post_init__ method
   - Module already well-typed with dataclasses

## Mypy Configuration:

Created two mypy configurations:
1. **mypy.ini** - Strict configuration for new code
2. **mypy-relaxed.ini** - Relaxed configuration for existing codebase

## Verification:

All critical modules pass mypy type checking with strict settings:
```bash
mypy src/utils/progress.py src/vtt_generator.py src/speaker_identifier.py src/transcription_processor.py src/feed_parser.py
```

## Benefits:
- Better IDE support with type hints
- Catch type-related bugs during development
- Improved code documentation
- Easier refactoring with type safety

## Next Steps:
- Continue with Phase 3: Implement Logging Best Practices
- Gradually add type hints to remaining modules
- Consider using type stubs for external dependencies
