# Test Markers Summary

## Overview

All test methods in the test suite have been marked with appropriate pytest markers as configured in `pytest.ini`.

## Markers Applied

### Unit Tests (@pytest.mark.unit)
Fast, isolated tests that mock all external dependencies:

- `test_config.py` - All test classes marked as unit tests
- `test_feed_parser.py` - All test classes marked as unit tests
- `test_file_organizer.py` - All test classes marked as unit tests
- `test_gemini_client.py` - All test classes marked as unit tests (API calls are mocked)
- `test_key_rotation_manager.py` - All test classes marked as unit tests
- `test_logging.py` - All test classes marked as unit tests
- `test_progress_tracker.py` - All test classes marked as unit tests
- `test_vtt_generator.py` - All test classes marked as unit tests

### Integration Tests (@pytest.mark.integration)
Tests that verify multiple components working together:

- `test_integration.py` - TestEndToEndPipeline class marked as integration test
- `test_orchestrator_integration.py` - TestOrchestratorIntegration class marked as integration test

## Running Tests by Marker

### Run only unit tests:
```bash
python -m pytest -m unit
```

### Run only integration tests:
```bash
python -m pytest -m integration
```

### Run all tests except integration:
```bash
python -m pytest -m "not integration"
```

### Run specific test types in parallel (requires pytest-xdist):
```bash
python -m pytest -m unit -n auto
```

## Benefits

1. **Faster Development Cycles**: Run only unit tests during development for quick feedback
2. **CI/CD Optimization**: Separate unit and integration tests in CI pipelines
3. **Resource Management**: Integration tests can be run less frequently or on specific triggers
4. **Test Organization**: Clear separation of test types makes the test suite more maintainable

## Implementation Details

The markers were added at the class level, which automatically applies them to all test methods within each class. This approach:
- Reduces repetition
- Makes it easier to maintain consistency
- Allows for easy identification of test types

All markers are properly configured in `pytest.ini` with descriptions and the `--strict-markers` flag ensures only defined markers can be used.
