- **Implementation**: `config/production.yaml` with optimized settings
- **Features**: Extended timeouts (10min), higher quotas (100/day), centralized logging
- **Production-Ready**: Comprehensive settings for real podcast processing

**Task 6.2: Operational Commands** ✅
- **Implementation**: Four new CLI commands in `src/cli.py`
  - `validate-feed`: RSS feed validation with detailed analysis
