- sanity check the length of the transcript vs length of episode
- if llm returns only part of the transcript ask it to continue and stitch the results together
- look up the youtube url
- validate that the description of the rss is captured in my download in case I want to use it later
- make sure that there is a tracking mechanism for which episodes have been transcribed and which are still pending
- have the option to specify episodes to be transcribed, either by episode number, by how many episodes, etc. i want flexibility over which episodes are transcribed
