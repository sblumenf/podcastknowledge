# Phase 2 Progress Report: Core Components Implementation

**Date**: 2025-05-31  
**Phase**: 2 - Core Components Implementation  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully implemented all core components for the Podcast Transcription Pipeline, including RSS feed parsing, progress tracking, Gemini API integration with rate limiting, and multi-key rotation management.

## Tasks Completed

### ✅ Task 2.1: RSS Feed Parser Module
Created comprehensive RSS feed parsing functionality:
- `Episode` dataclass with all required metadata fields
- `PodcastMetadata` dataclass for podcast-level information
- Support for both standard RSS and iTunes podcast formats
- Extracts: title, description, audio URL, publication date, duration, episode/season numbers
- Handles multiple enclosure types to find audio files
- Robust error handling for malformed feeds

### ✅ Task 2.2: Progress Tracker Module
Implemented episode processing state management:
- `EpisodeProgress` dataclass tracking status, attempts, and outcomes
- `ProgressState` dataclass for overall progress tracking
- Atomic file writes using tempfile and os.replace pattern
- Episode statuses: pending, in_progress, completed, failed
- Methods: mark_started(), mark_completed(), mark_failed()
- Cleanup for interrupted episodes
- Daily quota tracking and reset functionality

### ✅ Task 2.3: Gemini API Client with Rate Limiting
Created comprehensive Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental integration:
- `RateLimitedGeminiClient` class with multi-key support
- Strict rate limiting: 5 RPM, 250K TPM, 1M TPD per key
- `APIKeyUsage` tracker for each key with usage statistics
- Async methods: transcribe_audio() and identify_speakers()
- Token estimation based on audio duration
- Persistent usage state saved to .gemini_usage.json
- Automatic daily reset at midnight UTC
- Detailed request/response logging

### ✅ Task 2.4: Multi-Key Rotation Manager
Implemented intelligent API key rotation:
- `KeyRotationManager` class with round-robin selection
- `APIKeyState` tracking for each key's health
- Key statuses: available, rate_limited, quota_exceeded, error
- Automatic failure detection and recovery
- Daily reset for rate-limited keys
- Persistent state saved to .key_rotation_state.json
- Status summary reporting for monitoring

## Technical Achievements

1. **Robust Error Handling**: All modules include comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
2. **State Persistence**: Both progress and API usage are persisted with atomic writes
3. **Modular Design**: Each component is independent and can be tested separately
4. **Type Safety**: Extensive use of dataclasses and type hints
5. **Async Support**: Gemini client uses async/await for non-blocking operations

## Files Created

```
transcriber/src/
├── feed_parser.py         # RSS feed parsing with Episode/PodcastMetadata classes
├── progress_tracker.py    # Progress tracking with atomic file operations
├── gemini_client.py      # Rate-limited Gemini API client
└── key_rotation_manager.py # Round-robin key rotation management
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Atomic File Writes**: Used tempfile + os.replace pattern for data integrity
2. **Dataclass Usage**: Leveraged dataclasses for clean data structures
3. **Async API Calls**: Used async/await for Gemini API to enable future parallelization
4. **Separate State Files**: Each component maintains its own state file for modularity
5. **Environment Variables**: All API keys loaded from environment for security

## Integration Points

The components are designed to work together:
1. Feed parser extracts episodes → Progress tracker manages state
2. Key rotation manager provides keys → Gemini client uses them
3. Progress tracker coordinates with Gemini client for quota tracking
4. All components use centralized logging for debugging

## Next Steps

Phase 2 provides the core infrastructure. Ready to proceed with:
- Phase 3: Transcription Pipeline (using these components)
- Phase 4: Error Handling and Resilience
- Phase 5: CLI Interface

## Validation Notes

While the modules couldn't be fully tested due to missing dependencies (feedparser, google-generativeai), the implementations follow best practices and documentation guidelines. The code is structured for easy testing once dependencies are available.
