GitHub Actions Workflow Audit Results
=====================================

Workflows that install Python dependencies:
-------------------------------------------

1. tests.yml
   - test job: Uses requirements.txt + manually installs pytest packages (should use requirements-dev.txt)
   - lint job: Manually installs linting tools (already in requirements-dev.txt)
   - performance job: Uses requirements.txt + manually installs pytest packages (needs psutil!)
   - integration job: Uses requirements.txt + manually installs pytest packages

2. code-quality.yml
   - test-quality job: Uses requirements.txt + manually installs pytest packages

3. test-coverage.yml - Needs checking
4. release.yml - Needs checking

Issues Found:
-------------
1. All workflows use requirements.txt instead of requirements-dev.txt for testing
2. Testing dependencies are manually installed despite being in requirements-dev.txt
3. Performance tests will fail due to missing psutil (not installed in workflows)
4. Duplication of dependency installation logic across workflows

Recommendations:
----------------
1. Update all test-related jobs to use requirements-dev.txt
2. Remove manual installation of packages already in requirements-dev.txt
3. Ensure psutil is available for performance tests
