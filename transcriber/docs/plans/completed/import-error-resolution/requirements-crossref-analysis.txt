Requirements Cross-Reference Analysis
=====================================

Third-Party Dependencies Found in Code:
---------------------------------------
1. feedparser       - ✓ Present in requirements.txt
2. google-generativeai - ✓ Present in requirements.txt
3. psutil          - ✓ Present in requirements-dev.txt
4. pytest          - ✓ Present in both files
5. tenacity        - ✓ Present in requirements.txt
6. PyYAML          - ✓ Present in requirements.txt

Missing Dependencies:
--------------------
NONE - All third-party dependencies are properly declared.

Issues Found:
-------------
1. Duplication: pytest and related plugins appear in both requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt
   - pytest>=7.0.0
   - pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0
   - pytest-mock>=3.10.0

2. Misplaced Dependencies: Testing dependencies should only be in requirements-dev.txt, not in production requirements.txt

3. Additional dependency in requirements.txt not found in imports:
   - python-dotenv>=1.0.0 (might be used via environment or indirectly)

Recommendations:
----------------
1. Remove testing dependencies from requirements.txt (pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-mock)
2. Keep all testing dependencies only in requirements-dev.txt
3. Verify if python-dotenv is actually used in the codebase
