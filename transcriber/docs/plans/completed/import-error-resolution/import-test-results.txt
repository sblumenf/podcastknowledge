Import Test Results
===================

All Third-Party Imports Tested:
-------------------------------
✓ feedparser - Imports successfully
✓ google.generativeai - Imports successfully  
✓ psutil - Imports successfully
✓ pytest - Imports successfully
✓ tenacity - Imports successfully
✓ yaml - Imports successfully

Additional Findings:
-------------------
1. python-dotenv is listed in requirements.txt but not used anywhere in the codebase
   - No imports of dotenv or load_dotenv found
   - Could be removed from requirements.txt to minimize dependencies

2. All required dependencies are properly installed and functional

3. No missing dependencies identified

Conclusion:
-----------
The import error issue has been fully resolved with the addition of psutil to requirements-dev.txt.
All other dependencies were already properly declared and are functional.
