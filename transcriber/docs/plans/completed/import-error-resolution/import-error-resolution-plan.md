**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Completion Date**: 2025-06-05

## Executive Summary

This plan addresses the immediate psutil import error preventing test execution and implements a comprehensive audit system to identify and resolve all import-related issues across the codebase. The plan ensures development environment consistency and updates CI/CD configurations to prevent future import errors.

## Phase 1: Immediate psutil Resolution

### Task 1.1: Add psutil to development requirements
- [x] Task: Add psutil dependency to requirements-dev.txt
- Purpose: Resolve immediate import error in performance test files
- Steps:
  1. Use context7 MCP tool to check psutil documentation for version requirements
  2. Read current requirements-dev.txt file
  3. Determine appropriate psutil version (latest stable unless conflicts exist)
  4. Add psutil entry to requirements-dev.txt maintaining alphabetical order
  5. Save updated requirements-dev.txt
- Validation: 
  - File contains psutil entry
  - File maintains proper format

### Task 1.2: Verify psutil installation
- [x] Task: Install psutil in current environment
- Purpose: Confirm dependency resolves import errors
- Steps:
  1. Use context7 MCP tool to review pip documentation for best practices
  2. Activate virtual environment
  3. Run `pip install psutil` to test installation
  4. Run `python -c "import psutil; print(psutil.__version__)"` to verify
- Validation:
  - Import command executes without error
  - Version number is displayed

### Task 1.3: Test performance modules import
- [x] Task: Verify all performance test files can be imported
- Purpose: Confirm psutil resolves the identified import errors
- Steps:
  1. Use context7 MCP tool to check pytest documentation for import testing
  2. For each file: test_performance.py, test_performance_comprehensive.py, test_performance_fixed.py
  3. Run `python -c "import tests.test_performance"` for each
  4. Document any remaining import errors
- Validation:
  - All three test files import successfully
  - No ModuleNotFoundError for psutil

## Phase 2: Comprehensive Import Audit

  2. Create script that:
     - Walks through all .py files in src/ and tests/
     - Extracts import statements using AST
     - Identifies third-party vs standard library imports
     - Outputs list of unique external dependencies
  3. Save script as scripts/audit_imports.py
- Validation:
  - Script executes without errors
  - Produces list of all imports

### Task 2.2: Run import audit
- [x] Task: Execute import audit across entire codebase
- Purpose: Generate comprehensive list of all dependencies
- Steps:
  1. Use context7 MCP tool to review Python import system documentation
  2. Run audit script: `python scripts/audit_imports.py`
  3. Capture output to temporary file
  4. Parse results to identify third-party packages
- Validation:
  - Complete list of imports generated
  - Third-party packages clearly identified

### Task 2.3: Cross-reference with requirements
- [x] Task: Compare discovered imports against requirements files
- Purpose: Identify any missing dependencies
- Steps:
  1. Use context7 MCP tool to check pip documentation for package naming
  2. Read requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt
  3. Compare audit results with both files
  4. Create list of imports not in requirements
  5. Verify each missing import is actually a third-party package
- Validation:
  - Discrepancy list created
  - False positives (standard library) filtered out

### Task 2.4: Test missing imports
- [x] Task: Verify each missing dependency causes import errors
- Purpose: Confirm which dependencies actually need to be added
- Steps:
  1. Use context7 MCP tool to review Python module documentation
  2. For each potentially missing dependency:
     - Try importing in Python interpreter
     - Document if ImportError occurs
     - Note which files use this import
  3. Create final list of confirmed missing dependencies
- Validation:
  - Each missing dependency verified
  - Usage locations documented

## Phase 3: Update Requirements Files

### Task 3.1: Add missing dependencies
- [x] Task: Update requirements-dev.txt with all missing dependencies
- Purpose: Ensure all imports can be resolved
- Steps:
  1. Use context7 MCP tool to check each package's documentation
  2. For each confirmed missing dependency:
     - Research appropriate version constraints
     - Add to requirements-dev.txt in alphabetical order
     - Include comment if dependency is for specific test type
  3. Save updated requirements-dev.txt
- Validation:
  - All missing dependencies added
  - File maintains proper format

### Task 3.2: Test full installation
- [x] Task: Verify all dependencies install correctly
- Purpose: Ensure no conflicts between packages
- Steps:
  1. Use context7 MCP tool to review pip conflict resolution docs
  2. Create fresh virtual environment
  3. Run `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
  4. Document any conflicts or errors
  5. Resolve conflicts by adjusting version constraints
- Validation:
  - Installation completes without errors
  - No unresolved conflicts

## Phase 4: CI/CD Configuration Updates

### Task 4.1: Audit GitHub Actions workflows
