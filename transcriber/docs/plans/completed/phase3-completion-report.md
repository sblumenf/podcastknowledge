## Final State

## Progress Made
- Fixed 33 tests in Phase 3
- Overall progress: 148 → 181 passing tests (+33)
- Remaining failures are all in orchestrator/CLI integration tests

## Key Achievements
1. All core module tests are now passing
2. Integration tests fully functional
3. Only orchestrator/CLI tests remain (these require more complex refactoring)

## Commit
- 24d07af: Fix Phase 3 tests: Integration, Key Rotation, Logging, VTT Generator

## Recommendation
The remaining 10 failing tests are all in the orchestrator/CLI integration tests. These tests have significant architectural mismatches between test expectations and actual implementation. Recommend either:
1. Updating the tests to match the current implementation
2. Refactoring the orchestrator/CLI to match test expectations
3. Skipping these tests temporarily and creating new integration tests that properly test the current implementation

The core functionality is now well-tested with 181 passing tests.
