   - UI/CLI modules ≥ 60%

2. **All critical paths have comprehensive test coverage** including:
   - Happy path scenarios
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Concurrent operation scenarios

3. **CI/CD pipeline enforces coverage standards** with:
   - Automated test execution on all commits
   - Coverage reports on pull requests
   - Failing builds for coverage regression

4. **Performance benchmarks established** with:
   - Baseline processing times documented
   - Memory usage limits defined
   - Scalability limits identified

5. **Test suite execution time remains reasonable** (<10 minutes for full suite)

## Technology Requirements

This plan uses only existing technologies already in the project:
- pytest (already installed)
- pytest-cov (already installed)
- pytest-mock (already installed)
- pytest-asyncio (already installed)
- No new frameworks or tools required

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Test Complexity**: Some modules may require significant refactoring to be testable
   - Mitigation: Identify and refactor tightly coupled code first

2. **Mock Data Quality**: Poor mock data could hide real issues
   - Mitigation: Use production-like test data and validate against real API responses

3. **Test Maintenance Burden**: Large test suite could become difficult to maintain
   - Mitigation: Follow DRY principles, use fixtures effectively, document thoroughly

4. **False Confidence**: High coverage doesn't guarantee bug-free code
   - Mitigation: Focus on meaningful tests, not just line coverage

## Validation Checkpoints

After each phase:
1. Run full test suite and verify coverage targets
2. Review test quality with focus on meaningful assertions
3. Verify no regression in existing functionality
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Commit with descriptive messages indicating coverage improvements

## Final Validation

Before considering the system production-ready:
1. Run complete test suite with 0 failures
2. Achieve 85%+ overall coverage
3. Successfully process 10 test podcasts end-to-end
4. Verify all error recovery scenarios work
5. Pass performance benchmarks
6. Complete code review of all new tests
