[00:00] Mel Robbins: Hey, it's your friend Mel and welcome to the Mel Robbins Podcast.
[00:04] Mel Robbins: So I was scrolling through Tik Tok the other day and this one video stopped me in my tracks.
[00:14] Mel Robbins: It was a video by a young woman named Avi, and her handle if you want to check her out is being and becoming Avi.
[00:21] Mel Robbins: And she said something that really struck me, so I played it again.
[00:26] Mel Robbins: Basically, she said one of the reasons why so many of us don't like how we look is because human beings were never meant to see themselves this much.
[00:38] Mel Robbins: Just stop and think about that.
[00:39] Mel Robbins: It's true, isn't it?
[00:40] Mel Robbins: We're not supposed to be staring at ourselves all the time, whether it's on Zoom or taking selfies or scrolling through everyone else's curated, perfect looking lives.
[00:50] Mel Robbins: And that's exactly why our conversation today is so important.
[00:55] Mel Robbins: You and I are about to have a raw, unfiltered talk, unlike anything we've ever had before on this podcast because today, you and I are going to talk about something that affects every single one of us, even if you don't say it out loud.
[01:10] Mel Robbins: Body image, self-talk, picking yourself apart, those quiet moments of comparison and shame that shape how you see yourself and how that impacts the way you're showing up in the world.
[01:22] Mel Robbins: Maybe for you, it's acne that makes you want to just stay inside your apartment.
[01:28] Mel Robbins: Maybe it's a part of your body that you've spent years hiding or hating, or maybe it's something you can't change.
[01:34] Mel Robbins: Your height, your complexion, your body shape, your hair texture.
[01:38] Mel Robbins: You've convinced yourself that because of it, you're somehow less worthy of love, connection, or confidence.
[01:44] Mel Robbins: If any of that hits close to home for you or for someone you love, I want you to hear me loud and clear.
[01:52] Mel Robbins: You are not alone.
[01:54] Mel Robbins: If you've ever felt like you're not good enough, not attractive enough, not lovable because of how you look, if you're tired of comparing yourself to filtered faces and highlight reels, if you've ever looked in the mirror and thought, I wish I could change that.
[02:08] Mel Robbins: Then this episode is for you and it's for the people that you care about that are struggling to love themselves as they are.
[02:15] Mel Robbins: Because today we're talking about confidence, talking about body image.
[02:19] Mel Robbins: And you're also going to learn about something that researchers call the autoscopic phenomenon.
[02:24] Mel Robbins: Wait till you hear about this.
[02:27] Mel Robbins: And we're going to also talk about this sense that you're trapped in a body that you just don't like.
[02:33] Mel Robbins: And how that impacts comparison, shame, self-worth, how that may make you hide yourself when you don't like how you look.
[02:39] Mel Robbins: And most importantly, today, we're talking about healing.
[02:43] Mel Robbins: This is the conversation I wish I had had years ago because what you're about to hear, it's going to change the way you think about how you look and how you speak to yourself forever.
[03:04] Mel Robbins: Hey, it's your friend Mel and welcome to the Mel Robbins Podcast.
[03:09] Mel Robbins: I am so excited that you're here.
[03:11] Mel Robbins: I cannot wait for today's conversation.
[03:13] Mel Robbins: And first of all, it's always such an honor to spend time together and to be with you.
[03:17] Mel Robbins: And if you're new to the podcast, I also wanted to take a moment and personally welcome you to the Mel Robbins Podcast family.
[03:23] Mel Robbins: I'm excited that you're here for the conversation today.
[03:26] Mel Robbins: And because you made the time to listen to this particular episode, here's what I know about you.
[03:32] Mel Robbins: I know that you not only value your time, but you also want to feel more confident and you want to know how to accept yourself and learn how to love who you are as you are.
[03:42] Mel Robbins: And if you're here right now because somebody shared this episode with you, I want to point something out.
[03:48] Mel Robbins: It means that they care deeply about you and they want you to hear something and learn from some experts, some unbelievable information that is going to help you value yourself and be even more confident and you deserve that.
[04:01] Mel Robbins: And I think it's awesome that you have people in your life that care about you like that.
[04:05] Mel Robbins: Because today's conversation that we're going to have, it's a really important one.
[04:09] Mel Robbins: And I was inspired to do this because I sat down with a person by the name of Jake Shane.
[04:15] Mel Robbins: If you don't know Jake, trust me, every single 20 something and every high schooler in your life knows exactly who Jake Shane is.
[04:22] Mel Robbins: He is a comedian who is blowing up everywhere.
[04:25] Mel Robbins: In fact, he just won a Webby award for best comedic creator.
[04:30] Mel Robbins: He is on a sold out tour right now all across the United States.
[04:33] Mel Robbins: He has a hit podcast called Therapus, huge YouTube and Tik Tok following.
[04:38] Mel Robbins: And I had the honor of sitting down with Jake and being on his podcast.
[04:42] Mel Robbins: And when we sat down together, holy cow, he opened up in a way that he's never opened up before.
[04:50] Mel Robbins: He got so real.
[04:51] Mel Robbins: He said that he thinks he's ugly.
[04:54] Mel Robbins: He hates how he looks.
[04:55] Mel Robbins: He just hates that he's short.
[04:57] Mel Robbins: He obsesses over his body.
[05:00] Mel Robbins: And then he shared this painful story about when all of these feelings of self-hatred and body image started.
[05:07] Mel Robbins: And I thought to myself, how many of us have a story like this?
[05:11] Mel Robbins: You know, this moment when somebody said something to you, or you walked in a room and suddenly you felt like you were the tallest or the shortest or you didn't look like anybody else in there and you felt like you didn't belong and you started believing there was something wrong with you.
[05:26] Mel Robbins: Your height, your skin, your stomach, your face, the acne, hair, lack of hair.
[05:32] Mel Robbins: I mean, who hasn't looked in the mirror and thought, I hate this.
[05:35] Mel Robbins: I hate how I look.
[05:36] Mel Robbins: Why do I look like this?
[05:37] Mel Robbins: I wish I could look like that.
[05:39] Mel Robbins: Now, it's normal to have a thought like that every once in a while.
[05:43] Mel Robbins: But when those thoughts become the soundtrack in your mind, when they stop you from showing up or from wearing a bathing suit or jumping in the photo with your friends or going to the beach or going out on a date or putting yourself out there, when the thoughts about your body or your acne steal your confidence and they make you believe that you're not smart enough or worthy of love and happiness because of how you look, that's a problem.
[06:08] Mel Robbins: And I know you would agree that even though we know it's a problem, nobody really knows how to fix this, right?
[06:15] Mel Robbins: Well, that conversation that I had with Jake Shane on his podcast about body image, it got me thinking about the fact that he said out loud what so many people, including you, feel privately.
[06:28] Mel Robbins: So I thought, I want to go deeper into this topic.
[06:32] Mel Robbins: And that's what you and I are going to do today.
[06:33] Mel Robbins: And that's why I'm excited that you're here and I'm excited that you're going to take the time to listen to this and that you're also going to take the time to share this with people in your life where you're like, gosh, I wish they could just really see what I see.
[06:44] Mel Robbins: Why don't they see how beautiful they are?
[06:45] Mel Robbins: Why are they constantly hating on themselves?
[06:48] Mel Robbins: And I wanted you to understand, like I wanted to understand, why do so many of us feel this way?
[06:53] Mel Robbins: And more importantly, what do you do about it?
[06:56] Mel Robbins: So for today's episode, I'm doing something really special.
[07:00] Mel Robbins: I want to explain what you're about to hear.
[07:03] Mel Robbins: After my conversation with Jake Shane, I reached out to not one, but two world renowned psychiatrists, Columbia University's Dr. Judith Joseph and Harvard Medical School's Dr. Ashwini Nadkarni.
[07:17] Mel Robbins: These two experts are going to walk you through the topics of body image, self-acceptance, and confidence.
[07:23] Mel Robbins: And it is so important for you to hear from the very start.
[07:27] Mel Robbins: If you don't like how you look, if you think you're ugly, if you think if only you could change certain aspects of your appearance, your chin, your nose, your this, your that.
[07:38] Mel Robbins: Oh, well, then you'd be happier.
[07:40] Mel Robbins: Our experts will tell you, this is normal.
[07:43] Mel Robbins: And you are also going to learn how life in the modern world is impacting your body image and your self-confidence so much more than you even realize.
[07:53] Mel Robbins: You're going to learn about the connection between constantly seeing yourself on Zoom and selfies online, how that is negatively affecting your self-image and your mental health.
[08:02] Mel Robbins: And most importantly, you know this is the Mel Robbins podcast, so you're not leaving here without simple things that you can do backed by research, and there are in fact four steps that our world renowned experts are going to walk you through that you can start to do as you're listening to our experts explain them.
[08:21] Mel Robbins: These are the steps that will help you learn how to accept and love yourself, particularly if you hate how you look.
[08:29] Mel Robbins: Because I want you to hear something loud and clear from your friend Mel.
[08:32] Mel Robbins: You're not broken.
[08:33] Mel Robbins: In fact, you are beautiful.
[08:36] Mel Robbins: You may not see it, but I do.
[08:39] Mel Robbins: And so do the people that love you.
[08:41] Mel Robbins: And my mission with our conversation today is to get you to stop picking yourself apart and to stop caring so much about what other people may think and learn how to be kinder, more compassionate, and more confident in seeing and celebrating your unique, beautiful self.
[08:59] Mel Robbins: And one more thing, Jake, if you're listening, I love you.
[09:03] Mel Robbins: I am so proud of you and thank you.
[09:05] Mel Robbins: Thank you for being brave enough to share your story and for giving us all permission to listen and to talk about this.
[09:14] Mel Robbins: So, let me set up how we're going to dive into the topic.
[09:17] Mel Robbins: First, you're going to hear Jake Shane talk about how much he hates his looks and how it is impacting him and dating.
[09:24] Mel Robbins: Because one of the things that he really wants is to be in a relationship.
[09:29] Mel Robbins: And you're also going to hear Jake open up about how his height and deep insecurities make him feel like a real relationship, not going to happen.
[09:37] Mel Robbins: But let me be very clear.
[09:39] Mel Robbins: This is not a dating episode.
[09:42] Mel Robbins: This is a deeper conversation.
[09:45] Mel Robbins: It's about something most of us carry quietly and constantly in the background.
[09:50] Mel Robbins: It's about the thing you hate about yourself.
[09:53] Mel Robbins: And so I want you to stop and think about that one thing.
[09:55] Mel Robbins: Is it your complexion, your body, your teeth, your thighs, your voice, your face, the way it looks in photos, your hair, that thing that you constantly zero in on and rip apart.
[10:08] Mel Robbins: That thing that makes you want to hide or not smile or not speak up at work because we can be honest with one another.
[10:14] Mel Robbins: Most of us are not walking around thinking, oh my god, I'm just so beautiful today.
[10:19] Mel Robbins: You're walking around thinking, I look hideous.
[10:21] Mel Robbins: I'm this, I'm that.
[10:22] Mel Robbins: I'm not enough.
[10:23] Mel Robbins: My outfit blows.
[10:24] Mel Robbins: I wish I looked like this.
[10:25] Mel Robbins: But what's really going on underneath all this criticism is deep down, you're afraid that what you look like is going to get in the way of the life you want.
[10:36] Mel Robbins: You've convinced yourself that you're the problem.
[10:38] Mel Robbins: And when that belief takes root, when you think you're too ugly, too different, too short, too much acne, too far gone, too old, too this, too saggy, too baggy, it doesn't just keep you from love.
[10:49] Mel Robbins: It keeps you from life.
[10:51] Mel Robbins: That craving for connection, whether it's with a romantic partner or friends or being seen at work or just being somebody who gets you, it often masks something even more powerful, a deeper need to feel worthy.
[11:06] Mel Robbins: You deserve that.
[11:07] Mel Robbins: You deserve to feel like you're allowed to take up space, to be seen and to be celebrated and to stop apologizing for your body.
[11:16] Mel Robbins: So that's where we're going today.
[11:18] Mel Robbins: Because here's what I believe.
[11:19] Mel Robbins: You are not ugly.
[11:21] Mel Robbins: You're not unlovable.
[11:23] Mel Robbins: And if you ever felt like you don't deserve the things you want, whether it's a relationship or intimacy or just someone to hold your hand, I want you to stay with me because we're talking about the relationship you have with yourself and how to finally stop being the bully in your own head.
[11:38] Mel Robbins: So let's begin where the conversation with Jake Shane began.
[11:43] Mel Robbins: See, Jake admitted something to me.
[11:46] Mel Robbins: Jake said the thing that he wants most in life is a relationship.
[11:50] Mel Robbins: And so then I asked him to describe what would the relationship that he has in his mind, what would that feel like?
[11:57] Mel Robbins: He paused and he said, I don't know.
[12:01] Mel Robbins: I want the relationship to make me feel confident and I would like it to like give me more life experience.
[12:08] Mel Robbins: I want to be able to lay down with someone and watch TV, but also to feel romantic with them.
[12:16] Mel Robbins: He knows what he wants, but he's not sure how it would feel.
[12:21] Mel Robbins: Because here's the truth.
[12:23] Mel Robbins: It's really hard to ask for what you want when deep down you don't believe you deserve it.
[12:29] Mel Robbins: And if you've ever felt like that, if you ever avoided the mirror, stood in the back of a photo or laughed off a compliment because you just couldn't believe it was true, keep listening.
[12:39] Mel Robbins: You have to believe that you're worthy of being fully seen.
[12:42] Mel Robbins: And that being seen, this isn't insecurity that's stopping you, it's self-protection.
[12:48] Mel Robbins: You're afraid if somebody sees you naked or they see you without your makeup on or they see that you're actually bald and not the guy in the photo that you posted online, that they're going to reject you.
[12:58] Mel Robbins: I mean, it makes total sense.
[13:00] Mel Robbins: When you carry shame or judgment about your body, your past, your face, or the one thing you hate about yourself, it feels safer to keep people at arm's length, right?
[13:09] Mel Robbins: Because then you don't have to risk rejection.
[13:12] Mel Robbins: But that same armor that's protecting you as you act cool and you cross your arms and you put on the makeup and the perfect outfit and you always have a towel around you because you don't want them to see you naked, it also keeps love out.
[13:24] Mel Robbins: And that's why this moment with Jake hit me so hard.
[13:30] Mel Robbins: See, I asked Jake, well, if you know what you want, Jake, what's the biggest issue when it comes to dating?
[13:39] Mel Robbins: This is what Jake Shane had to say.
[13:44] Jake Shane: I feel my main issue with dating is I am so insecure.
[13:50] Jake Shane: I don't know how I'm going to share.
[13:52] Jake Shane: I feel like when you're in a relationship, you like share your body with someone almost.
[13:55] Jake Shane: Like you have to like be so vulnerable.
[13:58] Jake Shane: And I struggle so much with like to to be frank, like being like naked with someone.
[14:04] Mel Robbins: Have you ever been in a long-term committed relationship?
[14:06] Jake Shane: Never.
[14:07] Mel Robbins: And is it is part of it because you're uncomfortable being naked with somebody?
[14:11] Jake Shane: Yes.
[14:11] Jake Shane: I would say that's a huge, huge reason because it's how I carry myself.
[14:16] Mel Robbins: Okay.
[14:16] Jake Shane: Like I don't give off that like I want to take off my clothes and be with someone.
[14:21] Mel Robbins: Wow.
[14:23] Mel Robbins: Never been in a long-term committed relationship because you're uncomfortable being naked with someone.
[14:32] Mel Robbins: That sucks.
[14:34] Mel Robbins: And I have a feeling that you or somebody that you love can relate to that.
[14:38] Mel Robbins: Because the truth is, most people don't say that out loud.
[14:43] Mel Robbins: Most of us kind of keep the lights off and slink off to the bathroom.
[14:47] Mel Robbins: Most of us kind of pull our clothes together and hide our bodies.
[14:50] Mel Robbins: But that's exactly what Jake Shane's talking about.
[14:53] Mel Robbins: And that kind of insecurity, it doesn't just make you self-conscious.
[14:58] Mel Robbins: It makes you hide and it makes you feel unworthy of the person that you're with.
[15:03] Mel Robbins: Because when you're shrinking away from the very things that you want most, whether it's love, connection, partnership, because deep down there's this fear, if they really saw me, if they knew the real me, they wouldn't want me.
[15:17] Mel Robbins: That's why I wanted to bring in two world renowned experts to help us really unpack what's going on because Jake Shane's not the only person that feels this way.
[15:26] Mel Robbins: He's just got the courage and the confidence to talk about it because he's probably sick and tired of letting this hold him back.
[15:32] Mel Robbins: And I want you to hold on to the thing that you're judging yourself around, the ways in which you're shrinking as you listen to the experts who are going to join in on the conversation.
[15:42] Mel Robbins: And our experts are Dr. Judith Joseph, who is a double board certified psychiatrist.
[15:48] Mel Robbins: She is a leading mental health researcher and the author of the brand new bestseller, High Functioning.
[15:55] Mel Robbins: She's also a podcast favorite around here on the Mel Robbins podcast.
[16:00] Mel Robbins: And Dr. Ashwini, who is a professor at Harvard Medical School and a board certified psychiatrist at Mass General Brigham, specializes in anxiety, depression, OCD, PTSD, and ADHD.
[16:13] Mel Robbins: She is also the associate medical director of Brigham psychiatric specialties and interim vice chair for the faculty affairs in the Department of psychiatry.
[16:23] Mel Robbins: Now, both Dr. Ashwini and Dr. Joseph are here to help unpack these topics further for you and me.
[16:31] Mel Robbins: So, let's start with what actually is body language.
[16:36] Mel Robbins: And Dr. Ashwini requested that I call her Dr. Ash.
[16:40] Mel Robbins: So, Dr. Ash, why are we constantly seeing ourselves through this critical lens?
[16:47] Dr. Ash: First, I think it's helpful to define what we mean by body image issues.
[16:53] Dr. Ash: When people experience negative body image, what we mean by that is that there's a difference between what they view as their real self and what their idealized self is, right?
[17:06] Dr. Ash: Like there's this concept of who they think they are and who they think they should be.
[17:12] Dr. Ash: Now, with negative body image, there are a number of different influential factors.
[17:17] Dr. Ash: Gender, age, race, ethnicity, all of those can play a role.
[17:23] Dr. Ash: But socio-cultural factors can also be influential.
[17:27] Dr. Ash: For instance, our social values and our cultural norms.
[17:31] Dr. Ash: Now, as children age, their family members may initially play a role in their body image.
[17:38] Dr. Ash: But after some time, they're going to be exposed to their peer groups.
[17:42] Dr. Ash: And then they're going to start consuming media.
[17:44] Dr. Ash: For instance, the TV that they watch, the movies that they view, the books that they read, the magazine ads, and of course, social media consumption.
[17:55] Dr. Ash: They're going to be exposed to that concept of the idealized body image.
[18:00] Dr. Ash: And then that difference between their real self and their idealized self is going to be that much more prominent.
[18:08] Mel Robbins: Wow.
[18:09] Mel Robbins: There was a lot to unpack in that explanation from Dr. Ash.
[18:14] Mel Robbins: But as you listen, didn't she just put words to something that you feel, but you don't know how to explain?
[18:22] Mel Robbins: And I want to highlight a couple things.
[18:23] Mel Robbins: The fact that this is really a issue where you have a difference between who you are in reality and this idealized version in your mind that you think you should be.
[18:37] Mel Robbins: So when you're talking about that in the context of body image, it's like what you look like versus what you think you should look like.
[18:47] Mel Robbins: And that gap between the real self, that's you, and this idealized fantasy self that you have in your mind, this gap is where all the pain lives.
[18:58] Mel Robbins: This is where you and I pick ourselves apart.
[19:01] Mel Robbins: I look like this, but I want to look like that.
[19:03] Mel Robbins: This is where you compare.
[19:05] Mel Robbins: It's why you put filters on your face.
[19:07] Mel Robbins: It's why you freeze when people call on you at work because you don't want to be seen.
[19:12] Mel Robbins: You think you should look and sound different.
[19:15] Mel Robbins: What Dr. Ash is pointing out is that you and I constantly hold this idealized version of ourselves over our own heads.
[19:24] Mel Robbins: And this is exactly what Jake is feeling.
[19:27] Mel Robbins: He's not struggling with how he looks.
[19:30] Mel Robbins: I really want to highlight this.
[19:31] Mel Robbins: He's not struggling with how he looks.
[19:34] Mel Robbins: He is wrestling with the belief that there's a better version of him.
[19:40] Mel Robbins: And until he becomes that better looking version, he's not worthy of love.
[19:47] Mel Robbins: Just stop and consider that because you do the same thing.
[19:51] Mel Robbins: You say there's a better looking version of me.
[19:55] Mel Robbins: And until I become that version and fix these things, then I'm not worthy of the life and the experiences that I want.
[20:05] Mel Robbins: Do you know how heartbreaking that is?
[20:08] Mel Robbins: To feel this way, but never say it aloud?
[20:13] Mel Robbins: I really have to applaud Jake Shane because he did.
[20:16] Mel Robbins: And the moment he said it out loud, as we were talking, something shifted.
[20:21] Mel Robbins: Because when you name the thing that you're ashamed of, even just once, you take away its power to silently control you.
[20:28] Mel Robbins: And it allows you to take one small, powerful step toward the life you've been keeping yourself from living.
[20:36] Mel Robbins: So, take a second and just sit with everything that you and I have already talked about.
[20:43] Mel Robbins: And while you sit with this, I want to take a quick break and have our amazing sponsors share a few words with you.
[20:51] Mel Robbins: And while you're listening to our sponsors and you're thinking about what we've talked about so far, if someone that you love needs to hear this, and don't we all, share this with them right now.
[21:01] Mel Robbins: And don't go anywhere because when we return, we're going to go even deeper right to the heart of where these painful beliefs first took hold.
[21:12] Mel Robbins: And a little later, we're going to get to the four research back steps that help you learn how to love yourself.
[21:19] Mel Robbins: So stay with me.
[21:20] Mel Robbins: We'll be right back.
[21:34] Mel Robbins: Welcome back.
[21:34] Mel Robbins: It's your buddy Mel Robbins.
[21:36] Mel Robbins: I am so glad you're still here that you're listening.
[21:38] Mel Robbins: Thank you for taking a moment to share this with people that you care about.
[21:42] Mel Robbins: In just a little bit, we're going to be getting to the four steps you can take so that you feel confident today, so that you can learn to accept yourself as you are instead of beating yourself up all the time.
[21:54] Mel Robbins: Because maybe the thing that you want, like Jake Shane, is a relationship.
[21:58] Mel Robbins: Or maybe you just want to be able to post something on social media without a filter or without immediately taking it down.
[22:03] Mel Robbins: Maybe you want to be able to go out in public with no makeup.
[22:06] Mel Robbins: Wouldn't that be liberating?
[22:08] Mel Robbins: Or speak up at a meeting.
[22:10] Mel Robbins: Allow yourself to be seen even though you get a little flushed, or go to your job without obsessing over whether or not people are looking at your acne, or walk into a room without feeling self-conscious about your height or your weight or the outfit that you're wearing.
[22:24] Mel Robbins: Whatever it is that you want, whether it's love, confidence, or just the freedom to walk into a room without feeling so critical of yourself, whatever is holding you back probably isn't your body.
[22:37] Mel Robbins: It's the way you feel about your body and the way you talk to yourself about it.
[22:42] Mel Robbins: And that's exactly what Jake Shane and I got into next.
[22:45] Mel Robbins: Now, just a heads up, Jake and I are buddies and you're going to hear a little bit of back and forth and banter and playfulness, a little bit of tough love.
[22:55] Mel Robbins: We're going to interrupt each other.
[22:56] Mel Robbins: It's okay.
[22:57] Mel Robbins: But I want you to listen closely to what Jake shares because it is really important.
[23:05] Jake Shane: I'm a really confident guy, but I do not like how I feel about my body and I don't like how I feel about how I look on the outside.
[23:17] Mel Robbins: Okay.
[23:17] Jake Shane: Like like I'll look in the mirror and I'll like take my sides and I'll like pull them back like this.
[23:22] Mel Robbins: I've done that.
[23:23] Jake Shane: I would like to like just shave my sides off.
[23:25] Jake Shane: Um, I like have a bigger like bosom area.
[23:30] Mel Robbins: Uh-huh.
[23:31] Jake Shane: So I would like that to be flatter.
[23:33] Jake Shane: Um, I've been working out my arms a lot, but it it's not toned, it's more just like bigger.
[23:38] Jake Shane: I'd like to shrink it.
[23:39] Mel Robbins: Uh-huh.
[23:40] Jake Shane: Um, I don't like my chin.
[23:42] Jake Shane: I feel like I have kind of like a double chin.
[23:45] Jake Shane: I feel like I have a bump in my nose, but that's like kind of the least of it.
[23:48] Jake Shane: And then I really my at the end of the day, I hate how short I am.
[23:53] Jake Shane: I don't think it's fair.
[23:55] Jake Shane: Really and truly, like I think more guys would want me if I was taller.
[23:58] Jake Shane: That is at the end of the day what
[23:58] Jake Shane: I think.
[24:00] Mel Robbins: Do you want to know why more guys don't want you?
[24:02] Jake Shane: Why?
[24:03] Mel Robbins: Because you don't want yourself.
[24:05] Mel Robbins: You're focused on height
[24:07] Mel Robbins: because it's distracting you from actually doing the work of learning how to look in the mirror
[24:13] Mel Robbins: Right.
[24:13] Mel Robbins: and say
[24:15] Mel Robbins: I am going to do life with that guy.
[24:18] Mel Robbins: Like you only get to do life with one person.
[24:20] Mel Robbins: From the moment you're born till the moment that you die.
[24:23] Mel Robbins: You have one person to take care of.
[24:25] Mel Robbins: It's you.
[24:26] Mel Robbins: Oh, yeah.
[24:28] Mel Robbins: It's you.
[24:30] Mel Robbins: And so the best thing you could ever do for yourself
[24:33] Mel Robbins: is to learn how to look in the mirror and go, all right, this is what I got.
[24:38] Mel Robbins: This is the hand I was dealt.
[24:39] Mel Robbins: And there comes a point in time
[24:42] Mel Robbins: in life and I learned this so fucking late. Like it just I don't want you to do this to yourself.
[24:48] Mel Robbins: Like you have to learn if you want to be happier, you have to learn how to allow yourself to be happier.
[24:55] Mel Robbins: And there's something about
[24:58] Mel Robbins: you and the way you won't allow yourself to be happier.
[25:02] Jake Shane: Yeah.
[25:04] Jake Shane: I don't know why.
[25:07] Mel Robbins: Sometimes you don't have to.
[25:09] Jake Shane: Yeah.
[25:10] Mel Robbins: Sometimes, I think the first step in changing your life
[25:14] Mel Robbins: is admitting to yourself that how you're doing it is no longer working.
[25:19] Mel Robbins: You can be funny as hell and super successful and self-deprecating
[25:24] Mel Robbins: and actually allow yourself to be happy
[25:27] Mel Robbins: with who and how you are.
[25:29] Jake Shane: I just feel unhappy.
[25:31] Jake Shane: I base all my happiness in
[25:34] Jake Shane: um
[25:35] Jake Shane: like other things that happen to me.
[25:38] Jake Shane: I am not happy.
[25:39] Jake Shane: Like when I go to bed, like I don't feel happy in my body.
[25:43] Jake Shane: I don't feel happy in myself.
[25:45] Jake Shane: I just don't.
[25:47] Mel Robbins: That is
[25:49] Mel Robbins: so relatable
[25:52] Mel Robbins: and so
[25:54] Mel Robbins: painful.
[25:57] Mel Robbins: I don't feel happy in my body.
[26:01] Mel Robbins: I don't feel happy in myself.
[26:04] Mel Robbins: I just don't.
[26:06] Mel Robbins: Maybe you can relate to what Jake is saying.
[26:10] Mel Robbins: That when I go to bed at night, I don't feel happy in my body.
[26:13] Mel Robbins: I don't feel happy in myself.
[26:17] Mel Robbins: And maybe you're confident.
[26:19] Mel Robbins: Maybe you got a full life.
[26:21] Mel Robbins: You show up at work.
[26:23] Mel Robbins: You're doing the best that you can.
[26:25] Mel Robbins: But still
[26:27] Mel Robbins: there's this one thing that you can't stand.
[26:31] Mel Robbins: And Jake went on and on, the bump in his no, that's the least of it.
[26:35] Mel Robbins: The boobs, the fact that he wants to shave off his sides.
[26:38] Mel Robbins: I've said the same thing about the saddle bags that are starting to hit, you know, those kind of
[26:42] Mel Robbins: things that hang down on your face as you get older.
[26:46] Mel Robbins: The one thing you wish you could change, if only I could get rid of that, then I'd be happier, the part of you that no matter what else is going on,
[26:54] Mel Robbins: still makes you feel less than.
[26:58] Mel Robbins: So let me ask you something.
[27:00] Mel Robbins: Why do you do this to yourself?
[27:04] Mel Robbins: Why are you so quick to pick yourself apart?
[27:07] Mel Robbins: Why is it so hard to look in the mirror and just be okay with what you see?
[27:14] Mel Robbins: You know, I saw this video
[27:16] Mel Robbins: on Tik Tok
[27:18] Mel Robbins: that really
[27:20] Mel Robbins: made me start to look at this topic a little bit differently.
[27:25] Mel Robbins: This video is from a young woman named Avy.
[27:28] Mel Robbins: Her handle is being and becoming Avy.
[27:31] Mel Robbins: It's gone crazy viral.
[27:32] Mel Robbins: I'm talking millions of views and she shared this concept called the mirror fallacy.
[27:37] Mel Robbins: Now, she didn't come up with the concept, she was just sharing it online.
[27:41] Mel Robbins: But it's the idea that human beings, you and me, we were never meant to constantly see ourselves.
[27:46] Mel Robbins: And when you really think about it, it makes total sense.
[27:49] Mel Robbins: Like think about our ancestors.
[27:50] Mel Robbins: Were our grandparents constantly looking at themselves?
[27:54] Mel Robbins: No.
[27:55] Mel Robbins: But you and me?
[27:56] Mel Robbins: Oh my god, all we do is stare at ourselves between the constant Zoom calls, FaceTime calls, selfies, social media, the photos that you're taking, online school, the Tik Tok videos that you're creating, the reflections that you see in all the glass buildings around us, constantly staring at yourself.
[28:15] Mel Robbins: You're not meant to do that.
[28:17] Mel Robbins: That's what's making you curate yourself, judge yourself.
[28:20] Mel Robbins: It's exhausting.
[28:22] Mel Robbins: And here's the truth.
[28:23] Mel Robbins: Everybody feels the same way.
[28:25] Mel Robbins: It's the world we live in.
[28:26] Mel Robbins: In fact, while we were working on this episode, oh my gosh, the discussions with the producing team here at 143 Studios.
[28:33] Mel Robbins: We have this incredible video director, editor, David, love him.
[28:39] Mel Robbins: He was telling us that he had this ordinary morning.
[28:42] Mel Robbins: He was walking to work in Boston.
[28:44] Mel Robbins: He worked at this huge multinational corporation, big glass gorgeous building.
[28:49] Mel Robbins: You can imagine the type, right?
[28:50] Mel Robbins: And as he's walking into work, just random day, he catches his reflection in the window of the building.
[28:57] Mel Robbins: And then he noticed something.
[29:00] Mel Robbins: His knees, the way his pants slightly bend inward as he walks.
[29:05] Mel Robbins: And just like that, it became a thing.
[29:09] Mel Robbins: Couldn't stop seeing it.
[29:09] Mel Robbins: He couldn't stop wondering, do I walk weird?
[29:11] Mel Robbins: Do my legs look weird?
[29:13] Mel Robbins: Are my legs kind of bent in in a weird way?
[29:16] Mel Robbins: He didn't even stop and consider, is it this weird glass thing that's distorting it?
[29:20] Mel Robbins: And it made him though feel off, embarrassed, uncomfortable in his body.
[29:27] Mel Robbins: It made him want to shrink.
[29:28] Mel Robbins: And so if you're listening to this and you know that thing, whether it's the way your legs look when you walk or the, you know, something that happens with your shoulder when you're talking, you're not alone.
[29:39] Mel Robbins: And I'm here to tell you, it's not your fault and I have science to back this up.
[29:43] Mel Robbins: We were never meant to see ourselves this much.
[29:46] Mel Robbins: Not in the mirror, not on Zoom, not in selfies, not on videos, not even reflected in the buildings we're walking past.
[29:54] Mel Robbins: The truth is, you're not wired for constant self-surveillance.
[29:58] Mel Robbins: You're wired for something else.
[30:00] Mel Robbins: You're wired to be connected to other people.
[30:03] Mel Robbins: And this is so fascinating that I'm like, okay, what's the research here?
[30:07] Mel Robbins: And so I wanted to go even deeper because you and I need help understanding why is all of this messing with our mind, our body image and our self-confidence.
[30:17] Mel Robbins: So I called up our second world renowned expert to help us understand and get additional insights into what is seeing yourself all the time in modern life doing to you.
[30:26] Mel Robbins: Now, this is a woman who has led over 60 clinical research trials.
[30:32] Mel Robbins: She focuses on the high functioning mental health issues that so many people hide like anxiety and depression.
[30:39] Mel Robbins: I'm talking about none other than Dr. Judith Joseph.
[30:42] Mel Robbins: And what she explained stopped me in my tracks.
[30:46] Mel Robbins: It was something I had never heard before.
[30:48] Mel Robbins: She said, oh Mel, this is a phenomenon.
[30:51] Mel Robbins: It's called the autoscopic phenomenon.
[30:54] Mel Robbins: And it perfectly explains why you feel so self-critical all the time.
[31:01] Mel Robbins: Here's how Dr. Judith explained it, why it's harder than ever, not just for you, to shake the self-criticism and the issues with body image.
[31:13] Mel Robbins: Check this out.
[31:14] Dr. Judith Joseph: It's interesting because we were never made to look at ourselves all the time.
[31:19] Dr. Judith Joseph: But now we can't escape it.
[31:20] Dr. Judith Joseph: We're on these virtual meetings, we see ourselves while we're talking to other people.
[31:24] Dr. Judith Joseph: We're, you know, doing FaceTime, we see ourselves.
[31:27] Dr. Judith Joseph: We're creating content, we see ourselves.
[31:29] Dr. Judith Joseph: And actually, before we even had this ability to do this, there was something called the autoscopic phenomenon.
[31:37] Dr. Judith Joseph: And it's in the psychiatry world, where actually it was considered to be a symptom of psychosis to see yourself outside of yourself.
[31:45] Dr. Judith Joseph: So that actually creates so much anxiety for patients who, let's say have psychosis like schizophrenia or psychotic symptoms related to bipolar disorder or other psychotic conditions.
[31:57] Dr. Judith Joseph: And it's disturbing because because our brains and our eyes are made to look at other people and to judge their behavior and to get feedback from their behavior.
[32:06] Dr. Judith Joseph: That's how our brains were set up.
[32:08] Dr. Judith Joseph: Our brains weren't set up to do that when looking at ourselves.
[32:12] Dr. Judith Joseph: So that's why this autoscopic phenomenon is really important to look at and we're seeing some of this happening in real life with people who aren't psychotic, with people who don't have severe mental health issues, where it's creating anxiety for them to be constantly looking at their own image.
[32:30] Dr. Judith Joseph: It's just really unnatural.
[32:33] Mel Robbins: Okay.
[32:35] Mel Robbins: Let's just take that in for a minute.
[32:38] Mel Robbins: Because that's incredible that human beings, you and me, we are actually not wired to see ourselves outside of ourselves.
[32:49] Mel Robbins: And Dr. Judith wasn't done.
[32:52] Mel Robbins: Just get this next part that she explained.
[32:56] Dr. Judith Joseph: Our eyes were designed to look at others and to judge others to adapt.
[33:00] Dr. Judith Joseph: For example, we were designed with a brain to look at someone's face, their behavior, look at where their hands are as a way to protect ourselves and also as a way to connect with others, right?
[33:14] Dr. Judith Joseph: If you're not able to look at someone to see whether or not they're burring, you know, they're making a little wrinkle here or they're like looking sad, you don't know how to respond to them in order to attach because humans need other people to survive.
[33:27] Dr. Judith Joseph: So because our brains were designed to only look at other people in order to either survive because of living with them or to survive by fleeing from them, it's very unnatural for us to be looking at our own image because then what happens is that we start to judge ourselves, which is unnatural.
[33:45] Dr. Judith Joseph: We were never designed to be this way.
[33:47] Mel Robbins: That last line.
[33:48] Mel Robbins: We were never designed to be this way.
[33:50] Mel Robbins: We were actually not designed to judge ourselves.
[33:53] Mel Robbins: We were designed to judge other people either for connection or to be like, uh oh, stay away from that person.
[33:59] Mel Robbins: But now because we see ourselves all the time, holy cow, that judging mechanism, we're now aiming it at ourselves.
[34:09] Mel Robbins: And you've experienced this.
[34:10] Mel Robbins: You know when you're on a Zoom call or a FaceTime call and as you are talking or you're in a meeting, you're thinking, why does my face look like that?
[34:18] Mel Robbins: I better change the angle.
[34:19] Mel Robbins: You know, there's even a center at Stanford that studies this phenomenon.
[34:24] Mel Robbins: Now they called it Zoom fatigue, which to me just sounds like your brain is tired, but what Dr. Judith is actually saying is, no, no, no, no, Zoom fatigue is not just that your brain is tired.
[34:34] Mel Robbins: Zoom fatigue is that when you're staring at yourself, you lose perspective.
[34:38] Mel Robbins: You don't see yourself clearly.
[34:41] Mel Robbins: You now start judging yourself.
[34:44] Mel Robbins: And that's just the tip of the iceberg because now Dr. Ash is back from Harvard Medical School and she's going to take this entire thing that we're learning even deeper.
[34:54] Mel Robbins: Check this out.
[34:55] Dr. Ashwini Nadkarni: A study that was conducted during COVID lockdown amongst nearly 7,000 people actually showed that people because they were constantly looking at pictures of themselves on videos in meetings, nearly 30% of those individuals said that they had so much anxiety about coming back in to in person meetings, they were considering getting corrected action such as plastic surgery.
[35:19] Dr. Ashwini Nadkarni: So it goes to show you that as much as we are engaging in that process of social comparison between that real self and that idealized self, it really has a powerful effect on our psyches and our mental health and possible anxiety and depression as I did in that case.
[35:38] Mel Robbins: You know what I love about this conversation is that it seems like every problem in today's world is blamed on social media.
[35:45] Mel Robbins: And I love that we're going deeper and understanding the deeper levers and drivers in terms of the way that you're hardwired and how it's backfiring.
[35:57] Mel Robbins: Because it's not just social media.
[35:59] Mel Robbins: It's the constant taking of photos and the taking of videos.
[36:03] Mel Robbins: It's the looking at yourself online.
[36:06] Mel Robbins: No wonder anxiety is up.
[36:08] Mel Robbins: No wonder confidence is down.
[36:10] Mel Robbins: Because it's not just about what you're seeing in the mirror, you not only have this gap between the person that you are and this idealized version and then you start beating yourself up because you think you should look a different way, but now you add in the fact that you are seeing other people's filtered versions and highlight reels over and over and over again.
[36:31] Mel Robbins: And so your idealized self is completely unattainable.
[36:35] Mel Robbins: And on top of this, you're not wired for this.
[36:39] Mel Robbins: You're not supposed to see yourself.
[36:41] Mel Robbins: And frankly, you're not supposed to see everybody else all the time either.
[36:46] Mel Robbins: And so I was really curious about how all of this is fueling and connected to the rise in body and face criticism, why so many people are turning to cosmetic procedures or these 70 step face routines.
[37:02] Mel Robbins: So I went back to Dr. Judith Joseph to get her take.
[37:06] Mel Robbins: And I asked her, Dr. Judith, do you think the rise in body and face issues in terms of people criticizing themselves and feeling anxiety about how they look and the surge in cosmetic procedures, does it have something to do with how we're constantly seeing ourselves and we're not designed to do this?
[37:25] Mel Robbins: Here's what she had to say.
[37:26] Dr. Judith Joseph: I've seen this over the years as someone who treats adults and children, people going to constantly get procedures done, painful procedures, often unnecessary procedures that their doctors are like, listen, I don't see what you see, but you know, if it makes you happy, you can make this adjustment with plastic surgery, but it's never ending.
[37:44] Dr. Judith Joseph: You know, when we look at the science of happiness in my lab, when you have this idea that I will be happy when, and then you get the thing, right?
[37:53] Dr. Judith Joseph: You get the plastic surgery, you're still not happy.
[37:55] Dr. Judith Joseph: You're still looking for other things to fix.
[37:58] Dr. Judith Joseph: I see this all the time when people are fixated on specific physical aspects of themselves that other people don't agree with.
[38:07] Dr. Judith Joseph: And what I've found in my practice is that this is almost always related to some trauma early in life.
[38:12] Dr. Judith Joseph: And one of the symptoms of trauma is internalizing shame, blame, and low self worth.
[38:19] Dr. Judith Joseph: So the person's trying to fix this thing on the outside, but it's really something that needs to be repaired on the inside in terms of their self worth.
[38:27] Dr. Judith Joseph: But also society is showing us that there's this standard of beauty and if you don't fit it, then you're not beautiful.
[38:34] Dr. Judith Joseph: And because we have so much access to all of these images of other people who are beautiful, we have way more metrics to compare ourselves against.
[38:43] Dr. Judith Joseph: So it's a combination of unrepaired internal trauma and what we're seeing on the outside in terms of societal pressures, why we're seeing these numbers go up in terms of the amounts of procedures that are cosmetic.
[38:57] Mel Robbins: You know, I want to highlight something about what Dr. Judith is explaining that's really important.
[39:02] Mel Robbins: You think if you fix one thing on the outside, you will finally feel better on the inside.
[39:09] Mel Robbins: But it's never about the one thing that you see.
[39:11] Mel Robbins: And look, I'm not a psychiatrist.
[39:13] Mel Robbins: Luckily Dr. Judith is here and she dug into this even deeper to explain the connection between our obsession with how we look versus the deeper things that need healing that will actually make us happier.
[39:30] Mel Robbins: Check this out.
[39:31] Dr. Judith Joseph: It's usually related to some early childhood or early life trauma and the person has instead of resolving that inner wound, they have displaced this onto this external thing.
[39:44] Dr. Judith Joseph: As humans, we like to quantify, so we focus on the concrete, we focus on, oh my legs are short.
[39:51] Dr. Judith Joseph: Or we focus on, oh my toes are gross, you know, and we focus on these things, my ears are big, my chin sticks out and and these are the things that we can control because our concrete brains grasp onto them.
[40:02] Dr. Judith Joseph: They're things that we can see as, oh that's the problem.
[40:04] Dr. Judith Joseph: And if I just fix this one thing, it'll be better.
[40:07] Dr. Judith Joseph: And I can tell you, I've I've had these patients over the years where they'll get the surgery and they still find something else because it's not that one concrete physical thing.
[40:17] Dr. Judith Joseph: It's something within that it's all tied to this unresolved wound.
[40:21] Mel Robbins: I know you probably feel the same way that I do when these world renowned experts come on and tell us what we don't want to hear.
[40:28] Mel Robbins: Because like you, I am certain that if I just had longer hair or if I were just a little bit thinner, or if my skin were a little bit clearer, or my voice were a little bit deeper, then all my problems would go away.
[40:41] Mel Robbins: And that's not what the science and the research says at all.
[40:46] Mel Robbins: What Dr. Judith and Dr. Ash are saying is that we're chasing the wrong fix.
[40:51] Mel Robbins: Changing your appearance might give you a little boost, but it's not going to heal this feeling of being unworthy.
[40:59] Mel Robbins: It's not going to take care of that feeling that I just am not happy even though I did that thing to fix the thing that I thought I would fix because the wound was never physical to begin with.
[41:11] Mel Robbins: And so, I'm sure you're thinking, okay, I'm in, I get it.
[41:15] Mel Robbins: What do I do about it?
[41:17] Mel Robbins: I'm so glad you asked.
[41:18] Mel Robbins: Because we're going to take a short break so we can hear a word from our amazing sponsors.
[41:23] Mel Robbins: And while you're listening, I want you to share this with somebody in your life that is too hard on themselves because they deserve to hear this conversation too.
[41:33] Mel Robbins: And when we return, you're going to hear more from Dr. Judith and Dr. Ash because there are four research back steps that you're going to take in order to build a more confident and loving relationship with yourself and to start allowing happiness in now.
[41:49] Mel Robbins: So don't go anywhere.
[41:51] Mel Robbins: I'll be waiting for you after this short break.
[41:53] Mel Robbins: Stay with me.
[42:06] Mel Robbins: Hey, welcome back.
[42:07] Mel Robbins: It's your friend Mel.
[42:08] Mel Robbins: I am so glad that you are still here with me because today you and I are talking about why you feel stuck when it comes to the things that you don't like about your face, your body, your appearance.
[42:18] Mel Robbins: And that brings me to the four simple steps that according to Dr. Ash and according to Dr. Judith, these are the research back steps that you need to take in order to break free from all of this criticism and start feeling better and accepting yourself today.
[42:34] Mel Robbins: So, let's talk about these four steps.
[42:37] Mel Robbins: The first one and the second one, we've already kind of covered, but I really want to take a highlight and make sure you understand you've already done step one and you've already done step two.
[42:46] Mel Robbins: And step one is acknowledge that the world you live in today, the culture, that's the problem.
[42:53] Mel Robbins: You're not the problem, okay?
[42:56] Mel Robbins: You are not the problem.
[42:57] Mel Robbins: It's the world and the culture that we live in.
[43:00] Mel Robbins: The world that you live in is set up in a way to make you feel dissatisfied with yourself.
[43:07] Mel Robbins: The selfies, the videos, the Snapchats, the Zoom calls, the FaceTime calls, you're constantly exposed to images of yourself.
[43:15] Mel Robbins: And as you're learning, you're not designed to see yourself.
[43:20] Mel Robbins: You are designed to see and connect with other people, to scrutinize what they're doing in order to know if they're somebody you want to connect with or they're somebody you want to stay away from.
[43:31] Mel Robbins: And so when you see yourself, which you're not designed to do, automatically that same scrutiny kicks in.
[43:39] Mel Robbins: So it's not just the sheer number of photos either.
[43:43] Mel Robbins: I mean, think about what happened during the pandemic when everything shifted to video.
[43:47] Mel Robbins: Suddenly every meeting, every conversation, every class, on camera.
[43:52] Mel Robbins: That means you had to stare at yourself all day long.
[43:54] Mel Robbins: And when you're constantly staring at yourself, you're also constantly judging yourself.
[43:59] Mel Robbins: But here's the truth.
[44:01] Mel Robbins: There's nothing wrong with you.
[44:02] Mel Robbins: You don't need a different face.
[44:05] Mel Robbins: You don't need a different body.
[44:07] Mel Robbins: You need a different relationship with the body, the face, and the life you already have.
[44:15] Mel Robbins: Turn off the camera.
[44:16] Mel Robbins: Get off social media.
[44:17] Mel Robbins: And if you're unwilling to get off social media, how about you audit who you follow?
[44:22] Mel Robbins: Because if your feed is filled with Photoshopped models and influencers living a fake life trying to sell you stuff, uh, that's not helping.
[44:31] Mel Robbins: Because step one starts with understanding this.
[44:34] Mel Robbins: You're not the problem.
[44:36] Mel Robbins: Today's culture is the problem.
[44:39] Mel Robbins: Because it's screwing up how your brain is designed to move through the world and what you're supposed to be looking at.
[44:47] Mel Robbins: Doesn't it feel good to say, oh, it's not me.
[44:49] Mel Robbins: I'm perfectly, imperfectly beautiful.
[44:51] Mel Robbins: There's only one me, period.
[44:54] Mel Robbins: And step two, you have to look back before you can move forward.
[45:00] Mel Robbins: I'm going to say that again.
[45:01] Mel Robbins: You have to look back before you can move forward.
[45:06] Mel Robbins: And here's where this connects back to you.
[45:09] Mel Robbins: Figuring out where your own negative self-talk started is key.
[45:15] Mel Robbins: Because here's what I know to be true.
[45:17] Mel Robbins: Here is what Dr. Judith and Dr. Ash said over and over.
[45:21] Mel Robbins: You didn't come into this world hating your body.
[45:23] Mel Robbins: You were not born picking yourself apart in the mirror.
[45:27] Mel Robbins: All that shame, all that self-judgment, all that criticism, all of that belief that something is wrong with how you look, it was taught to you.
[45:37] Mel Robbins: Maybe it came from a kid at school who made fun of your nose.
[45:40] Mel Robbins: Maybe it was a comment from a family member about your weight that stuck like glue.
[45:44] Mel Robbins: Maybe it was somebody constantly fussing with the way that you dressed or your teeth or your skin or whatever.
[45:50] Mel Robbins: Maybe it was the pressure of growing up online and constantly scrolling past people that you thought looked better than you or whose life looked better than yours.
[45:59] Mel Robbins: And you started to tell yourself, well, that's what beauty's supposed to look like.
[46:02] Mel Robbins: But here's what I want you to know.
[46:04] Mel Robbins: And this is good news.
[46:06] Mel Robbins: If it was taught, it can be unlearned.
[46:10] Mel Robbins: Mhm.
[46:11] Mel Robbins: If you learn to hate yourself, you can learn to love yourself.
[46:15] Mel Robbins: If somebody else taught you to criticize yourself or to make you believe that you were not good enough because of how you looked, you can unlearn this crap and you need to.
[46:27] Mel Robbins: And part of that unlearning is understanding why you became so critical in the first place.
[46:34] Mel Robbins: That's where the healing begins.
[46:36] Mel Robbins: And those roots may go a lot further back than you realize.
[46:41] Mel Robbins: And in order to prove this, let's go back to our buddy Jake Shane.
[46:46] Mel Robbins: What he shares next is not just about body image, it's about the exact moment shame gets planted and how fast it grows when you're not willing to talk about it.
[46:58] Mel Robbins: So I asked Jake, where did you get the idea that there was something wrong with your body?
[47:04] Mel Robbins: And this is what Jake Shane had to say.
[47:07] Jake Shane: Someone made a comment when I was in fourth or fifth grade and it really stuck with me.
[47:12] Mel Robbins: What did they say?
[47:13] Jake Shane: That I was fat.
[47:14] Mel Robbins: Okay.
[47:15] Jake Shane: And um
[47:17]
