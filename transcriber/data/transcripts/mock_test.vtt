00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.900
Welcome to the Mel Robbins Podcast. I'm so excited you're here today because we
have an incredible conversation about feeling good in your body.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:29.900
Today's guest is going to share four expert steps that will help you feel more
confident starting right now. This is a conversation that could truly change how
you see yourself.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:41.900
Thank you so much for having me, Mel. I'm thrilled to be here to talk about body
confidence because it's something that affects so many of us.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:59.900
Absolutely. Let's dive right in. What's the first step someone can take today to
start feeling better in their body?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:14.900
The first step is really about changing your internal dialogue. Most of us have
a very critical voice when it comes to our bodies.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:27.900
We need to start by becoming aware of that voice and then actively working to
shift it to something more compassionate and supportive.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.900
That's so powerful. Can you give us an example of how someone might do that?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:47.900
Of course. Instead of looking in the mirror and immediately focusing on what you
don't like, try to find one thing you appreciate about your body.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:04.900
It could be something as simple as "my legs are strong and they carried me
through my day" or "my arms allow me to hug the people I love."

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.900
I love that reframe. It's about gratitude and function rather than just
appearance.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.900
Exactly. The second step builds on this - it's about movement for joy, not
punishment.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.900
Tell me more about that. I think so many people exercise because they feel they
have to, not because they want to.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:49.900
Right. We've been conditioned to think of exercise as a way to "burn off" food
or "fix" our bodies. But what if we moved simply because it feels good?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:04.900
Find movement that brings you joy - dancing, walking in nature, playing with
your kids. It doesn't have to be a grueling gym session.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000
This is such an important shift in mindset. What's the third step?
