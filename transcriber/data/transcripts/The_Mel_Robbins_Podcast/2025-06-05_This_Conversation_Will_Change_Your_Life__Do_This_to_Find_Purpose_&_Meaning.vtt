00:00:00.408 --> 00:00:04.138
<v Mel Robbins> Hey, it's your friend Mel, and welcome to the Mel Robbins podcast.

00:00:04.138 --> 00:00:08.338
<v Mel> You know, I am so excited to share this episode with you.

00:00:08.338 --> 00:00:12.778
<v Mel> It is a conversation that I had recently with my friend, Adam Grant.

00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:17.368
<v Mel> And if you don't know who Adam Grant is, he is an organizational psychologist.

00:00:17.368 --> 00:00:21.038
<v Mel> He is a number one New York Times bestselling author.

00:00:21.038 --> 00:00:24.498
<v Mel> He is a professor at Wharton, and he is one of the most

00:00:24.498 --> 00:00:27.768
<v Mel> downloaded and popular TED Talk speakers ever.

00:00:27.768 --> 00:00:31.788
<v Mel> And the reason why I wanted to have Adam on the podcast is because

00:00:31.788 --> 00:00:36.198
<v Mel> he has a brand new book out. It's called Hidden Potential.

00:00:36.198 --> 00:00:40.098
<v Mel> And the topic of this book is something that I am so passionate

00:00:40.098 --> 00:00:41.348
<v Mel> about.

00:00:41.348 --> 00:00:45.368
<v Mel> And I know based on the questions that you send into me every day,

00:00:45.368 --> 00:00:48.338
<v Mel> that this is something that you're passionate about too.

00:00:48.338 --> 00:00:52.688
<v Mel> And that is, how do you find and achieve your potential?

00:00:52.688 --> 00:00:56.598
<v Mel> How do you figure out what you're meant to do with your life?

00:00:56.598 --> 00:01:00.678
<v Mel> How do you tap into that feeling that there's something more for you?

00:01:00.678 --> 00:01:04.488
<v Mel> How do you find more meaning or more purpose in your life?

00:01:04.488 --> 00:01:08.628
<v Mel> And what I love about Adam's work and what he shares with you

00:01:08.628 --> 00:01:12.878
<v Mel> in this conversation is that your potential is not determined

00:01:12.878 --> 00:01:15.398
<v Mel> by your innate talent.

00:01:15.398 --> 00:01:19.098
<v Mel> It's not determined by where you start.

00:01:19.098 --> 00:01:23.018
<v Mel> It's not determined by how smart you are or how popular you are.

00:01:23.018 --> 00:01:27.428
<v Mel> Your potential is determined by how willing you are

00:01:27.428 --> 00:01:29.338
<v Mel> to learn and grow.

00:01:29.338 --> 00:01:33.458
<v Mel> And in this conversation, Adam is going to teach you

00:01:33.458 --> 00:01:37.788
<v Mel> a framework that you can use to figure out what it is

00:01:37.788 --> 00:01:41.018
<v Mel> you want to do with your life and how to get started.

00:01:41.018 --> 00:01:44.758
<v Mel> He's also going to explain why you don't need to be afraid

00:01:44.758 --> 00:01:47.038
<v Mel> of trying new things.

00:01:47.038 --> 00:01:50.848
<v Mel> And he's going to share a story about a guy named Michael

00:01:50.848 --> 00:01:55.228
<v Mel> that is going to blow your mind and help you see that it is never

00:01:55.228 --> 00:01:57.018
<v Mel> too late to start.

00:01:57.018 --> 00:02:00.898
<v Mel> And I got to tell you, this conversation with Adam, it was so good.

00:02:00.898 --> 00:02:04.898
<v Mel> It was so tactical that I actually stopped the interview at one point

00:02:04.898 --> 00:02:09.118
<v Mel> and I asked him to coach me on something that I'm struggling with.

00:02:09.118 --> 00:02:12.878
<v Mel> And what he shared with me, it not only helped me,

00:02:12.878 --> 00:02:16.488
<v Mel> it is something that you can use to make any decision

00:02:16.488 --> 00:02:18.298
<v Mel> in your life easier.

00:02:18.298 --> 00:02:22.098
<v Mel> And so I want to dive right into this incredible conversation

00:02:22.098 --> 00:02:24.008
<v Mel> with my friend, Adam Grant.

00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:27.898
<v Mel> Adam, it is so good to see you. Welcome to the Mel Robbins podcast.

00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:29.618
<v Guest> Mel, it's great to be here.

00:02:29.618 --> 00:02:32.748
<v Mel> I am so excited to talk to you because you have a new book out

00:02:32.748 --> 00:02:34.528
<v Mel> called Hidden Potential.

00:02:34.528 --> 00:02:38.288
<v Mel> And I have to tell you, I was so excited to read it

00:02:38.288 --> 00:02:42.098
<v Mel> because the topic of potential is something that I think about

00:02:42.098 --> 00:02:43.168
<v Mel> all the time.

00:02:43.168 --> 00:02:46.608
<v Mel> And I know our listeners do too, because one of the number one questions

00:02:46.608 --> 00:02:50.738
<v Mel> I get Adam is, how do I figure out what I want to do with my life?

00:02:50.738 --> 00:02:54.388
<v Mel> How do I figure out what my potential is? How do I find my purpose?

00:02:54.388 --> 00:02:57.978
<v Mel> And so I'm really excited to talk to you about this.

00:02:57.978 --> 00:03:01.388
<v Mel> And I want to start with a question that I have for you,

00:03:01.388 --> 00:03:05.128
<v Mel> which is why this topic and why now?

00:03:05.128 --> 00:03:08.178
<v Guest> Well, I think this is a topic that's been on my mind my whole life.

00:03:08.178 --> 00:03:11.998
<v Guest> I was, I was the kid who was not picked for the basketball team.

00:03:11.998 --> 00:03:15.398
<v Guest> I was the, the diver who belly flopped his way through

00:03:15.398 --> 00:03:17.078
<v Guest> most of his early career.

00:03:17.078 --> 00:03:20.598
<v Guest> And I've always been fascinated by how people who are overlooked

00:03:20.598 --> 00:03:22.848
<v Guest> and underestimated end up surprising us.

00:03:22.848 --> 00:03:26.388
<v Guest> And I think that the reason to write about it now is

00:03:26.388 --> 00:03:30.228
<v Guest> I feel like we live in a world that is way too obsessed with talent.

00:03:30.228 --> 00:03:33.898
<v Guest> We worship people who have these extraordinary god-given gifts,

00:03:33.898 --> 00:03:37.788
<v Guest> or at least they seem to be god-given. And we overlook the fact

00:03:37.788 --> 00:03:41.488
<v Guest> that the people who make the greatest strides are often the ones

00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:43.348
<v Guest> who started out with ordinary abilities,

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:46.098
<v Guest> but did extraordinary things to develop them.

00:03:46.098 --> 00:03:49.738
<v Guest> And I wanted to understand how they do that and what we can learn from them.

00:03:49.738 --> 00:03:53.488
<v Mel> I love that. And I want to just pick up on something you said,

00:03:53.488 --> 00:03:57.258
<v Mel> which is that we live in a world that is obsessed with talent.

00:03:57.258 --> 00:04:00.838
<v Mel> And I think that that is one of the major things that holds people back

00:04:00.838 --> 00:04:02.508
<v Mel> from finding their potential.

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:06.208
<v Mel> Because if you believe that you're either born with it or you're not,

00:04:06.208 --> 00:04:09.738
<v Mel> then you don't even bother to try to develop the skills.

00:04:09.738 --> 00:04:13.198
<v Mel> You don't bother to try to find something that you might be good at.

00:04:13.198 --> 00:04:16.828
<v Mel> You just assume, well, I'm not talented, so I'm screwed.

00:04:16.828 --> 00:04:20.178
<v Guest> I think that's exactly right. I think that the, the problem with

00:04:20.178 --> 00:04:23.958
<v Guest> the talent obsession is it leads a lot of people to count themselves out.

00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:27.768
<v Guest> It also leads a lot of organizations to make bad bets on people.

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:31.098
<v Guest> And I think it's time to rethink that. I think that, you know,

00:04:31.098 --> 00:04:34.468
<v Guest> if you look at the evidence, the science is very clear that

00:04:34.468 --> 00:04:38.278
<v Guest> potential is less about the height of your peak than the distance

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.388
<v Guest> you travel to get there.

00:04:39.388 --> 00:04:42.848
<v Guest> It's about how far you've come and how far you still have to go.

00:04:42.848 --> 00:04:46.408
<v Guest> And that's a function of not where you start, but how steep your

00:04:46.408 --> 00:04:47.748
<v Guest> growth curve is.

00:04:47.748 --> 00:04:51.188
<v Mel> So, say more about that because I think that's really important.

00:04:51.188 --> 00:04:55.038
<v Mel> That potential is not about the height of your peak,

00:04:55.038 --> 00:04:57.438
<v Mel> but the distance you travel.

00:04:57.438 --> 00:05:01.078
<v Guest> Yeah, I think that we tend to judge potential by looking at

00:05:01.078 --> 00:05:02.828
<v Guest> how high somebody has already climbed.

00:05:02.828 --> 00:05:06.188
<v Guest> So, you know, if you're, if you're trying to figure out who has the most potential

00:05:06.188 --> 00:05:09.698
<v Guest> in a classroom, you look at who has the best grades. If you're trying to figure out

00:05:09.698 --> 00:05:12.928
<v Guest> who has the most potential in a sport, you look at who's already the star player.

00:05:12.928 --> 00:05:16.818
<v Guest> And what we miss when we do that is we don't see how much

00:05:16.818 --> 00:05:19.918
<v Guest> scaffolding somebody had to get to that point.

00:05:19.918 --> 00:05:23.438
<v Guest> We don't see how many advantages they had, how many disadvantages

00:05:23.438 --> 00:05:24.778
<v Guest> they might have overcome.

00:05:24.778 --> 00:05:28.438
<v Guest> And I think a much better way to gauge potential is to look at

00:05:28.438 --> 00:05:30.048
<v Guest> how much progress somebody has made.

00:05:30.048 --> 00:05:33.638
<v Guest> So, you know, if you take two students, one of them starts out with an A+

00:05:33.638 --> 00:05:35.618
<v Guest> and ends with an A+.

00:05:35.618 --> 00:05:38.868
<v Guest> The other one starts out with a C- and works their way up to an A-.

00:05:38.868 --> 00:05:42.068
<v Guest> I think the second student has shown a lot more potential.

00:05:42.068 --> 00:05:45.598
<v Guest> They've demonstrated a capacity to learn and grow. And that's what

00:05:45.598 --> 00:05:47.388
<v Guest> I think potential is all about.

00:05:47.388 --> 00:05:51.198
<v Mel> I love that. And I think it's so important for everybody listening

00:05:51.198 --> 00:05:54.918
<v Mel> to really let that sink in because it's not about where you start.

00:05:54.918 --> 00:05:58.468
<v Mel> It's about the progress that you make. And I think that's so empowering

00:05:58.468 --> 00:06:01.888
<v Mel> because it means that anybody, regardless of their circumstances,

00:06:01.888 --> 00:06:04.208
<v Mel> can achieve their potential.

00:06:04.208 --> 00:06:07.818
<v Guest> Yeah, I think that's right. And I think that, you know, one of the things that

00:06:07.818 --> 00:06:11.438
<v Guest> I try to do in the book is to show that there are these skills

00:06:11.438 --> 00:06:14.888
<v Guest> of character that we can all develop that allow us to punch

00:06:14.888 --> 00:06:16.328
<v Guest> above our weight.

00:06:16.328 --> 00:06:19.928
<v Guest> And these are things like being proactive, being a sponge,

00:06:19.928 --> 00:06:23.568
<v Guest> being an imperfectionist, being a structure builder.

00:06:23.568 --> 00:06:27.028
<v Guest> And these are not fixed traits. They're learnable skills.

00:06:27.028 --> 00:06:30.598
<v Guest> And I think that's one of the most exciting things about the science of potential.

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:33.998
<v Mel> So let's talk about those skills because I think that's really where the rubber

00:06:33.998 --> 00:06:35.138
<v Mel> meets the road.

00:06:35.138 --> 00:06:38.648
<v Mel> You talk about these three character skills.

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:42.278
<v Mel> The first one is being proactive. What does that mean?

00:06:42.278 --> 00:06:45.898
<v Guest> So being proactive is about taking initiative. It's about

00:06:45.898 --> 00:06:49.498
<v Guest> not waiting for permission or for instructions. It's about

00:06:49.498 --> 00:06:52.848
<v Guest> seeing a problem and trying to solve it, or seeing an opportunity

00:06:52.848 --> 00:06:54.278
<v Guest> and trying to seize it.

00:06:54.278 --> 00:06:57.988
<v Guest> And I think that, you know, a lot of people think that proactivity is something

00:06:57.988 --> 00:07:00.028
<v Guest> that you're either born with or you're not.

00:07:00.028 --> 00:07:03.448
<v Guest> But the evidence actually shows that it's a skill that you can learn.

00:07:03.448 --> 00:07:07.038
<v Guest> And one of the ways you can learn it is by practicing what I call

00:07:07.038 --> 00:07:08.838
<v Guest> "job crafting."

00:07:08.838 --> 00:07:12.378
<v Mel> Okay, so what is job crafting? Because that sounds really interesting.

00:07:12.378 --> 00:07:16.038
<v Guest> So job crafting is basically redesigning your job to make it

00:07:16.038 --> 00:07:17.508
<v Guest> more meaningful and engaging.

00:07:17.508 --> 00:07:21.038
<v Guest> And there are three ways to do it. The first is task crafting,

00:07:21.038 --> 00:07:24.378
<v Guest> which is changing the number or the scope or the nature of your tasks.

00:07:24.378 --> 00:07:28.108
<v Guest> The second is relational crafting, which is changing who you interact with

00:07:28.108 --> 00:07:29.188
<v Guest> on the job.

00:07:29.188 --> 00:07:32.618
<v Guest> And the third is cognitive crafting, which is changing how you think

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:34.038
<v Guest> about your job.

00:07:34.038 --> 00:07:37.668
<v Mel> Okay, so give me an example of how somebody could use job crafting

00:07:37.668 --> 00:07:39.708
<v Mel> to be more proactive.

00:07:39.708 --> 00:07:43.208
<v Guest> So let's say you're a hospital cleaner, and your job is to clean rooms.

00:07:43.208 --> 00:07:46.858
<v Guest> That's the task. But you could task craft by saying,

00:07:46.858 --> 00:07:50.458
<v Guest> "You know what? I'm not just going to clean rooms. I'm going to try to make

00:07:50.458 --> 00:07:52.698
<v Guest> patients feel more comfortable."

00:07:52.698 --> 00:07:56.098
<v Guest> So you might rearrange the flowers, or you might, you know,

00:07:56.098 --> 00:07:58.908
<v Guest> talk to the patients and try to cheer them up.

00:07:58.908 --> 00:08:02.488
<v Guest> That's task crafting. Relational crafting would be, you know,

00:08:02.488 --> 00:08:05.908
<v Guest> instead of just interacting with the nurses, you might also interact

00:08:05.908 --> 00:08:08.008
<v Guest> with the doctors or the patients' families.

00:08:08.008 --> 00:08:11.638
<v Guest> And cognitive crafting would be to say, "You know what? My job is not just

00:08:11.638 --> 00:08:14.998
<v Guest> to clean rooms. My job is to help heal people."

00:08:14.998 --> 00:08:18.498
<v Guest> And when you do those things, you're taking initiative, you're being proactive,

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:21.698
<v Guest> and you're making your job more meaningful and engaging.

00:08:21.698 --> 00:08:25.208
<v Mel> I love that. And I think that's such a powerful example because it shows

00:08:25.208 --> 00:08:28.788
<v Mel> that even if you're in a job that you don't necessarily love,

00:08:28.788 --> 00:08:32.208
<v Mel> you can still find ways to make it more meaningful and engaging.

00:08:32.208 --> 00:08:35.848
<v Guest> Exactly. And I think that, you know, the research on job crafting shows

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:39.498
<v Guest> that it leads to higher job satisfaction, higher performance,

00:08:39.498 --> 00:08:41.368
<v Guest> and lower burnout.

00:08:41.368 --> 00:08:44.768
<v Guest> So it's a really powerful tool for unlocking your potential.

00:08:44.768 --> 00:08:48.298
<v Mel> Okay, so the second character skill you talk about is being a sponge.

00:08:48.298 --> 00:08:50.008
<v Mel> What does that mean?

00:08:50.008 --> 00:08:53.478
<v Guest> So being a sponge is about being open to learning and feedback.

00:08:53.478 --> 00:08:57.078
<v Guest> It's about recognizing that you don't know everything and that you can

00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:58.738
<v Guest> always learn from others.

00:08:58.738 --> 00:09:02.268
<v Guest> And I think that, you know, a lot of people are afraid of feedback

00:09:02.268 --> 00:09:05.348
<v Guest> because they see it as criticism. But if you can reframe it

00:09:05.348 --> 00:09:08.308
<v Guest> as an opportunity to learn and grow, then it becomes

00:09:08.308 --> 00:09:09.798
<v Guest> a really valuable tool.

00:09:09.798 --> 00:09:13.288
<v Mel> And how do you become more of a sponge? Because I think a lot of people

00:09:13.288 --> 00:09:16.638
<v Mel> do struggle with receiving feedback, especially if it's negative.

00:09:16.638 --> 00:09:20.088
<v Guest> So one way is to actively seek out feedback.

00:09:20.088 --> 00:09:23.478
<v Guest> Don't wait for it to come to you. Go ask for it.

00:09:23.478 --> 00:09:26.868
<v Guest> And when you get it, try to listen with an open mind.

00:09:26.868 --> 00:09:30.298
