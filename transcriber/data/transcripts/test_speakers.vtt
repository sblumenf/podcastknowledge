00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.900
<v Mel Robbins> Welcome to the Mel Robbins Podcast. I'm so excited you're here
today because we have an incredible conversation about feeling good in your
body.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:29.900
<v Mel Robbins> Today's guest is going to share four expert steps that will help
you feel more confident starting right now.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:41.900
<v Guest Expert> Thank you so much for having me, Mel. I'm thrilled to be here
to talk about body confidence.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:59.900
<v Mel Robbins>Absolutely. Let's dive right in. What's the first step?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:14.900
<v Guest Expert>The first step is really about changing your internal dialogue.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:27.900
<v Guest Expert> We need to start by becoming aware of that voice and then
actively working to shift it.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.900
<v Mel Robbins>That's so powerful. Can you give us an example?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Guest Expert> Of course. Instead of looking in the mirror and immediately
focusing on what you don't like, try to find one thing you appreciate.
