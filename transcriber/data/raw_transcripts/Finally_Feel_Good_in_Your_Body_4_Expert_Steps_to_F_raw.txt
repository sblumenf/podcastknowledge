[00:00] Mel Robbins: Hey, it's your friend Mel and welcome to the Mel Robbins Podcast.
[00:04] Mel Robbins: So I was scrolling through Tik Tok the other day and this one video stopped me in my tracks.
[00:14] Mel Robbins: It was a video by a young woman named Avi, and her handle if you want to check her out is being and becoming Avi.
[00:21] Mel Robbins: And she said something that really struck me, so I played it again.
[00:26] Mel Robbins: Basically, she said one of the reasons why so many of us don't like how we look is because human beings were never meant to see themselves this much.
[00:38] Mel Robbins: Just stop and think about that.
[00:39] Mel Robbins: It's true, isn't it?
[00:40] Mel Robbins: We're not supposed to be staring at ourselves all the time, whether it's on Zoom or taking selfies or scrolling through everyone else's curated, perfect looking lives.
[00:50] Mel Robbins: And that's exactly why our conversation today is so important.
[00:55] Mel Robbins: You and I are about to have a raw, unfiltered talk, unlike anything we've ever had before on this podcast because today, you and I are going to talk about something that affects every single one of us, even if you don't say it out loud.
[01:10] Mel Robbins: Body image, self-talk, picking yourself apart, those quiet moments of comparison and shame that shape how you see yourself and how that impacts the way you're showing up in the world.
[01:22] Mel Robbins: Maybe for you, it's acne that makes you want to just stay inside your apartment.
[01:28] Mel Robbins: Maybe it's a part of your body that you've spent years hiding or hating, or maybe it's something you can't change.
[01:34] Mel Robbins: Your height, your complexion, your body shape, your hair texture.
[01:38] Mel Robbins: You've convinced yourself that because of it, you're somehow less worthy of love, connection, or confidence.
[01:44] Mel Robbins: If any of that hits close to home for you or for someone you love, I want you to hear me loud and clear.
[01:52] Mel Robbins: You are not alone.
[01:54] Mel Robbins: If you've ever felt like you're not good enough, not attractive enough, not lovable because of how you look, if you're tired of comparing yourself to filtered faces and highlight reels, if you've ever looked in the mirror and thought, I wish I could change that.
[02:08] Mel Robbins: Then this episode is for you and it's for the people that you care about that are struggling to love themselves as they are.
[02:15] Mel Robbins: Because today we're talking about confidence, talking about body image.
[02:19] Mel Robbins: And you're also going to learn about something that researchers call the autoscopic phenomenon.
[02:24] Mel Robbins: Wait till you hear about this.
[02:27] Mel Robbins: And we're going to also talk about this sense that you're trapped in a body that you just don't like.
[02:33] Mel Robbins: And how that impacts comparison, shame, self-worth, how that may make you hide yourself when you don't like how you look.
[02:39] Mel Robbins: And most importantly, today, we're talking about healing.
[02:43] Mel Robbins: This is the conversation I wish I had had years ago because what you're about to hear, it's going to change the way you think about how you look and how you speak to yourself forever.
[03:04] Mel Robbins: Hey, it's your friend Mel and welcome to the Mel Robbins Podcast.
[03:09] Mel Robbins: I am so excited that you're here.
[03:11] Mel Robbins: I cannot wait for today's conversation.
[03:13] Mel Robbins: And first of all, it's always such an honor to spend time together and to be with you.
[03:17] Mel Robbins: And if you're new to the podcast, I also wanted to take a moment and personally welcome you to the Mel Robbins Podcast family.
[03:23] Mel Robbins: I'm excited that you're here for the conversation today.
[03:26] Mel Robbins: And because you made the time to listen to this particular episode, here's what I know about you.
[03:32] Mel Robbins: I know that you not only value your time, but you also want to feel more confident and you want to know how to accept yourself and learn how to love who you are as you are.
[03:42] Mel Robbins: And if you're here right now because somebody shared this episode with you, I want to point something out.
[03:48] Mel Robbins: It means that they care deeply about you and they want you to hear something and learn from some experts, some unbelievable information that is going to help you value yourself and be even more confident and you deserve that.
[04:01] Mel Robbins: And I think it's awesome that you have people in your life that care about you like that.
[04:05] Mel Robbins: Because today's conversation that we're going to have, it's a really important one.
[04:09] Mel Robbins: And I was inspired to do this because I sat down with a person by the name of Jake Shane.
[04:15] Mel Robbins: If you don't know Jake, trust me, every single 20 something and every high schooler in your life knows exactly who Jake Shane is.
[04:22] Mel Robbins: He is a comedian who is blowing up everywhere.
[04:25] Mel Robbins: In fact, he just won a Webby award for best comedic creator.
[04:30] Mel Robbins: He is on a sold out tour right now all across the United States.
[04:33] Mel Robbins: He has a hit podcast called Therapus, huge YouTube and Tik Tok following.
[04:38] Mel Robbins: And I had the honor of sitting down with Jake and being on his podcast.
[04:42] Mel Robbins: And when we sat down together, holy cow, he opened up in a way that he's never opened up before.
[04:50] Mel Robbins: He got so real.
[04:51] Mel Robbins: He said that he thinks he's ugly.
[04:54] Mel Robbins: He hates how he looks.
[04:55] Mel Robbins: He just hates that he's short.
[04:57] Mel Robbins: He obsesses over his body.
[05:00] Mel Robbins: And then he shared this painful story about when all of these feelings of self-hatred and body image started.
[05:07] Mel Robbins: And I thought to myself, how many of us have a story like this?
[05:11] Mel Robbins: You know, this moment when somebody said something to you, or you walked in a room and suddenly you felt like you were the tallest or the shortest or you didn't look like anybody else in there and you felt like you didn't belong and you started believing there was something wrong with you.
[05:26] Mel Robbins: Your height, your skin, your stomach, your face, the acne, hair, lack of hair.
[05:32] Mel Robbins: I mean, who hasn't looked in the mirror and thought, I hate this.
[05:35] Mel Robbins: I hate how I look.
[05:36] Mel Robbins: Why do I look like this?
[05:37] Mel Robbins: I wish I could look like that.
[05:39] Mel Robbins: Now, it's normal to have a thought like that every once in a while.
[05:43] Mel Robbins: But when those thoughts become the soundtrack in your mind, when they stop you from showing up or from wearing a bathing suit or jumping in the photo with your friends or going to the beach or going out on a date or putting yourself out there, when the thoughts about your body or your acne steal your confidence and they make you believe that you're not smart enough or worthy of love and happiness because of how you look, that's a problem.
[06:08] Mel Robbins: And I know you would agree that even though we know it's a problem, nobody really knows how to fix this, right?
[06:15] Mel Robbins: Well, that conversation that I had with Jake Shane on his podcast about body image, it got me thinking about the fact that he said out loud what so many people, including you, feel privately.
[06:28] Mel Robbins: So I thought, I want to go deeper into this topic.
[06:32] Mel Robbins: And that's what you and I are going to do today.
[06:33] Mel Robbins: And that's why I'm excited that you're here and I'm excited that you're going to take the time to listen to this and that you're also going to take the time to share this with people in your life where you're like, gosh, I wish they could just really see what I see.
[06:44] Mel Robbins: Why don't they see how beautiful they are?
[06:45] Mel Robbins: Why are they constantly hating on themselves?
[06:48] Mel Robbins: And I wanted you to understand, like I wanted to understand, why do so many of us feel this way?
[06:53] Mel Robbins: And more importantly, what do you do about it?
[06:56] Mel Robbins: So for today's episode, I'm doing something really special.
[07:00] Mel Robbins: I want to explain what you're about to hear.
[07:03] Mel Robbins: After my conversation with Jake Shane, I reached out to not one, but two world renowned psychiatrists, Columbia University's Dr. Judith Joseph and Harvard Medical School's Dr. Ashwini Nadkarni.
[07:17] Mel Robbins: These two experts are going to walk you through the topics of body image, self-acceptance, and confidence.
[07:23] Mel Robbins: And it is so important for you to hear from the very start.
[07:27] Mel Robbins: If you don't like how you look, if you think you're ugly, if you think if only you could change certain aspects of your appearance, your chin, your nose, your this, your that.
[07:38] Mel Robbins: Oh, well, then you'd be happier.
[07:40] Mel Robbins: Our experts will tell you, this is normal.
[07:43] Mel Robbins: And you are also going to learn how life in the modern world is impacting your body image and your self-confidence so much more than you even realize.
[07:53] Mel Robbins: You're going to learn about the connection between constantly seeing yourself on Zoom and selfies online, how that is negatively affecting your self-image and your mental health.
[08:02] Mel Robbins: And most importantly, you know this is the Mel Robbins podcast, so you're not leaving here without simple things that you can do backed by research, and there are in fact four steps that our world renowned experts are going to walk you through that you can start to do as you're listening to our experts explain them.
[08:21] Mel Robbins: These are the steps that will help you learn how to accept and love yourself, particularly if you hate how you look.
[08:29] Mel Robbins: Because I want you to hear something loud and clear from your friend Mel.
[08:32] Mel Robbins: You're not broken.
[08:33] Mel Robbins: In fact, you are beautiful.
[08:36] Mel Robbins: You may not see it, but I do.
[08:39] Mel Robbins: And so do the people that love you.
[08:41] Mel Robbins: And my mission with our conversation today is to get you to stop picking yourself apart and to stop caring so much about what other people may think and learn how to be kinder, more compassionate, and more confident in seeing and celebrating your unique, beautiful self.
[08:59] Mel Robbins: And one more thing, Jake, if you're listening, I love you.
[09:03] Mel Robbins: I am so proud of you and thank you.
[09:05] Mel Robbins: Thank you for being brave enough to share your story and for giving us all permission to listen and to talk about this.
[09:14] Mel Robbins: So, let me set up how we're going to dive into the topic.
[09:17] Mel Robbins: First, you're going to hear Jake Shane talk about how much he hates his looks and how it is impacting him and dating.
[09:24] Mel Robbins: Because one of the things that he really wants is to be in a relationship.
[09:29] Mel Robbins: And you're also going to hear Jake open up about how his height and deep insecurities make him feel like a real relationship, not going to happen.
[09:37] Mel Robbins: But let me be very clear.
[09:39] Mel Robbins: This is not a dating episode.
[09:42] Mel Robbins: This is a deeper conversation.
[09:45] Mel Robbins: It's about something most of us carry quietly and constantly in the background.
[09:50] Mel Robbins: It's about the thing you hate about yourself.
[09:53] Mel Robbins: And so I want you to stop and think about that one thing.
[09:55] Mel Robbins: Is it your complexion, your body, your teeth, your thighs, your voice, your face, the way it looks in photos, your hair, that thing that you constantly zero in on and rip apart.
[10:08] Mel Robbins: That thing that makes you want to hide or not smile or not speak up at work because we can be honest with one another.
[10:14] Mel Robbins: Most of us are not walking around thinking, oh my god, I'm just so beautiful today.
[10:19] Mel Robbins: You're walking around thinking, I look hideous.
[10:21] Mel Robbins: I'm this, I'm that.
[10:22] Mel Robbins: I'm not enough.
[10:23] Mel Robbins: My outfit blows.
[10:24] Mel Robbins: I wish I looked like this.
[10:25] Mel Robbins: But what's really going on underneath all this criticism is deep down, you're afraid that what you look like is going to get in the way of the life you want.
[10:36] Mel Robbins: You've convinced yourself that you're the problem.
[10:38] Mel Robbins: And when that belief takes root, when you think you're too ugly, too different, too short, too much acne, too far gone, too old, too this, too saggy, too baggy, it doesn't just keep you from love.
[10:49] Mel Robbins: It keeps you from life.
[10:51] Mel Robbins: That craving for connection, whether it's with a romantic partner or friends or being seen at work or just being somebody who gets you, it often masks something even more powerful, a deeper need to feel worthy.
[11:06] Mel Robbins: You deserve that.
[11:07] Mel Robbins: You deserve to feel like you're allowed to take up space, to be seen and to be celebrated and to stop apologizing for your body.
[11:16] Mel Robbins: So that's where we're going today.
[11:18] Mel Robbins: Because here's what I believe.
[11:19] Mel Robbins: You are not ugly.
[11:21] Mel Robbins: You're not unlovable.
[11:23] Mel Robbins: And if you ever felt like you don't deserve the things you want, whether it's a relationship or intimacy or just someone to hold your hand, I want you to stay with me because we're talking about the relationship you have with yourself and how to finally stop being the bully in your own head.
[11:38] Mel Robbins: So let's begin where the conversation with Jake Shane began.
[11:43] Mel Robbins: See, Jake admitted something to me.
[11:46] Mel Robbins: Jake said the thing that he wants most in life is a relationship.
[11:50] Mel Robbins: And so then I asked him to describe what would the relationship that he has in his mind, what would that feel like?
[11:57] Mel Robbins: He paused and he said, I don't know.
[12:01] Mel Robbins: I want the relationship to make me feel confident and I would like it to like give me more life experience.
[12:08] Mel Robbins: I want to be able to lay down with someone and watch TV, but also to feel romantic with them.
[12:16] Mel Robbins: He knows what he wants, but he's not sure how it would feel.
[12:21] Mel Robbins: Because here's the truth.
[12:23] Mel Robbins: It's really hard to ask for what you want when deep down you don't believe you deserve it.
[12:29] Mel Robbins: And if you've ever felt like that, if you ever avoided the mirror, stood in the back of a photo or laughed off a compliment because you just couldn't believe it was true, keep listening.
[12:39] Mel Robbins: You have to believe that you're worthy of being fully seen.
[12:42] Mel Robbins: And that being seen, this isn't insecurity that's stopping you, it's self-protection.
[12:48] Mel Robbins: You're afraid if somebody sees you naked or they see you without your makeup on or they see that you're actually bald and not the guy in the photo that you posted online, that they're going to reject you.
[12:58] Mel Robbins: I mean, it makes total sense.
[13:00] Mel Robbins: When you carry shame or judgment about your body, your past, your face, or the one thing you hate about yourself, it feels safer to keep people at arm's length, right?
[13:09] Mel Robbins: Because then you don't have to risk rejection.
[13:12] Mel Robbins: But that same armor that's protecting you as you act cool and you cross your arms and you put on the makeup and the perfect outfit and you always have a towel around you because you don't want them to see you naked, it also keeps love out.
[13:24] Mel Robbins: And that's why this moment with Jake hit me so hard.
[13:30] Mel Robbins: See, I asked Jake, well, if you know what you want, Jake, what's the biggest issue when it comes to dating?
[13:39] Mel Robbins: This is what Jake Shane had to say.
[13:44] Jake Shane: I feel my main issue with dating is I am so insecure.
[13:50] Jake Shane: I don't know how I'm going to share.
[13:52] Jake Shane: I feel like when you're in a relationship, you like share your body with someone almost.
[13:55] Jake Shane: Like you have to like be so vulnerable.
[13:58] Jake Shane: And I struggle so much with like to to be frank, like being like naked with someone.
[14:04] Mel Robbins: Have you ever been in a long-term committed relationship?
[14:06] Jake Shane: Never.
[14:07] Mel Robbins: And is it is part of it because you're uncomfortable being naked with somebody?
[14:11] Jake Shane: Yes.
[14:11] Jake Shane: I would say that's a huge, huge reason because it's how I carry myself.
[14:16] Mel Robbins: Okay.
[14:16] Jake Shane: Like I don't give off that like I want to take off my clothes and be with someone.
[14:21] Mel Robbins: Wow.
[14:23] Mel Robbins: Never been in a long-term committed relationship because you're uncomfortable being naked with someone.
[14:32] Mel Robbins: That sucks.
[14:34] Mel Robbins: And I have a feeling that you or somebody that you love can relate to that.
[14:38] Mel Robbins: Because the truth is, most people don't say that out loud.
[14:43] Mel Robbins: Most of us kind of keep the lights off and slink off to the bathroom.
[14:47] Mel Robbins: Most of us kind of pull our clothes together and hide our bodies.
[14:50] Mel Robbins: But that's exactly what Jake Shane's talking about.
[14:53] Mel Robbins: And that kind of insecurity, it doesn't just make you self-conscious.
[14:58] Mel Robbins: It makes you hide and it makes you feel unworthy of the person that you're with.
[15:03] Mel Robbins: Because when you're shrinking away from the very things that you want most, whether it's love, connection, partnership, because deep down there's this fear, if they really saw me, if they knew the real me, they wouldn't want me.
[15:17] Mel Robbins: That's why I wanted to bring in two world renowned experts to help us really unpack what's going on because Jake Shane's not the only person that feels this way.
[15:26] Mel Robbins: He's just got the courage and the confidence to talk about it because he's probably sick and tired of letting this hold him back.
[15:32] Mel Robbins: And I want you to hold on to the thing that you're judging yourself around, the ways in which you're shrinking as you listen to the experts who are going to join in on the conversation.
[15:42] Mel Robbins: And our experts are Dr. Judith Joseph, who is a double board certified psychiatrist.
[15:48] Mel Robbins: She is a leading mental health researcher and the author of the brand new bestseller, High Functioning.
[15:55] Mel Robbins: She's also a podcast favorite around here on the Mel Robbins podcast.
[16:00] Mel Robbins: And Dr. Ashwini, who is a professor at Harvard Medical School and a board certified psychiatrist at Mass General Brigham, specializes in anxiety, depression, OCD, PTSD, and ADHD.
[16:13] Mel Robbins: She is also the associate medical director of Brigham psychiatric specialties and interim vice chair for the faculty affairs in the Department of psychiatry.
[16:23] Mel Robbins: Now, both Dr. Ashwini and Dr. Joseph are here to help unpack these topics further for you and me.
[16:31] Mel Robbins: So, let's start with what actually is body language.
[16:36] Mel Robbins: And Dr. Ashwini requested that I call her Dr. Ash.
[16:40] Mel Robbins: So, Dr. Ash, why are we constantly seeing ourselves through this critical lens?
[16:47] Dr. Ash: First, I think it's helpful to define what we mean by body image issues.
[16:53] Dr. Ash: When people experience negative body image, what we mean by that is that there's a difference between what they view as their real self and what their idealized self is, right?
[17:06] Dr. Ash: Like there's this concept of who they think they are and who they think they should be.
[17:12] Dr. Ash: Now, with negative body image, there are a number of different influential factors.
[17:17] Dr. Ash: Gender, age, race, ethnicity, all of those can play a role.
[17:23] Dr. Ash: But socio-cultural factors can also be influential.
[17:27] Dr. Ash: For instance, our social values and our cultural norms.
[17:31] Dr. Ash: Now, as children age, their family members may initially play a role in their body image.
[17:38] Dr. Ash: But after some time, they're going to be exposed to their peer groups.
[17:42] Dr. Ash: And then they're going to start consuming media.
[17:44] Dr. Ash: For instance, the TV that they watch, the movies that they view, the books that they read, the magazine ads, and of course, social media consumption.
[17:55] Dr. Ash: They're going to be exposed to that concept of the idealized body image.
[18:00] Dr. Ash: And then that difference between their real self and their idealized self is going to be that much more prominent.
[18:08] Mel Robbins: Wow.
[18:09] Mel Robbins: There was a lot to unpack in that explanation from Dr. Ash.
[18:14] Mel Robbins: But as you listen, didn't she just put words to something that you feel, but you don't know how to explain?
[18:22] Mel Robbins: And I want to highlight a couple things.
[18:23] Mel Robbins: The fact that this is really a issue where you have a difference between who you are in reality and this idealized version in your mind that you think you should be.
[18:37] Mel Robbins: So when you're talking about that in the context of body image, it's like what you look like versus what you think you should look like.
[18:47] Mel Robbins: And that gap between the real self, that's you, and this idealized fantasy self that you have in your mind, this gap is where all the pain lives.
[18:58] Mel Robbins: This is where you and I pick ourselves apart.
[19:01] Mel Robbins: I look like this, but I want to look like that.
[19:03] Mel Robbins: This is where you compare.
[19:05] Mel Robbins: It's why you put filters on your face.
[19:07] Mel Robbins: It's why you freeze when people call on you at work because you don't want to be seen.
[19:12] Mel Robbins: You think you should look and sound different.
[19:15] Mel Robbins: What Dr. Ash is pointing out is that you and I constantly hold this idealized version of ourselves over our own heads.
[19:24] Mel Robbins: And this is exactly what Jake is feeling.
[19:27] Mel Robbins: He's not struggling with how he looks.
[19:30] Mel Robbins: I really want to highlight this.
[19:31] Mel Robbins: He's not struggling with how he looks.
[19:34] Mel Robbins: He is wrestling with the belief that there's a better version of him.
[19:40] Mel Robbins: And until he becomes that better looking version, he's not worthy of love.
[19:47] Mel Robbins: Just stop and consider that because you do the same thing.
[19:51] Mel Robbins: You say there's a better looking version of me.
[19:55] Mel Robbins: And until I become that version and fix these things, then I'm not worthy of the life and the experiences that I want.
[20:05] Mel Robbins: Do you know how heartbreaking that is?
[20:08] Mel Robbins: To feel this way, but never say it aloud?
[20:13] Mel Robbins: I really have to applaud Jake Shane because he did.
[20:16] Mel Robbins: And the moment he said it out loud, as we were talking, something shifted.
[20:21] Mel Robbins: Because when you name the thing that you're ashamed of, even just once, you take away its power to silently control you.
[20:28] Mel Robbins: And it allows you to take one small, powerful step toward the life you've been keeping yourself from living.
[20:36] Mel Robbins: So, take a second and just sit with everything that you and I have already talked about.
[20:43] Mel Robbins: And while you sit with this, I want to take a quick break and have our amazing sponsors share a few words with you.
[20:51] Mel Robbins: And while you're listening to our sponsors and you're thinking about what we've talked about so far, if someone that you love needs to hear this, and don't we all, share this with them right now.
[21:01] Mel Robbins: And don't go anywhere because when we return, we're going to go even deeper right to the heart of where these painful beliefs first took hold.
[21:12] Mel Robbins: And a little later, we're going to get to the four research back steps that help you learn how to love yourself.
[21:19] Mel Robbins: So stay with me.
[21:20] Mel Robbins: We'll be right back.
[21:34] Mel Robbins: Welcome back.
[21:34] Mel Robbins: It's your buddy Mel Robbins.
[21:36] Mel Robbins: I am so glad you're still here that you're listening.
[21:38] Mel Robbins: Thank you for taking a moment to share this with people that you care about.
[21:42] Mel Robbins: In just a little bit, we're going to be getting to the four steps you can take so that you feel confident today, so that you can learn to accept yourself as you are instead of beating yourself up all the time.
[21:54] Mel Robbins: Because maybe the thing that you want, like Jake Shane, is a relationship.
[21:58] Mel Robbins: Or maybe you just want to be able to post something on social media without a filter or without immediately taking it down.
[22:03] Mel Robbins: Maybe you want to be able to go out in public with no makeup.
[22:06] Mel Robbins: Wouldn't that be liberating?
[22:08] Mel Robbins: Or speak up at a meeting.
[22:10] Mel Robbins: Allow yourself to be seen even though you get a little flushed, or go to your job without obsessing over whether or not people are looking at your acne, or walk into a room without feeling self-conscious about your height or your weight or the outfit that you're wearing.
[22:24] Mel Robbins: Whatever it is that you want, whether it's love, confidence, or just the freedom to walk into a room without feeling so critical of yourself, whatever is holding you back probably isn't your body.
[22:37] Mel Robbins: It's the way you feel about your body and the way you talk to yourself about it.
[22:42] Mel Robbins: And that's exactly what Jake Shane and I got into next.
[22:45] Mel Robbins: Now, just a heads up, Jake and I are buddies and you're going to hear a little bit of back and forth and banter and playfulness, a little bit of tough love.
[22:55] Mel Robbins: We're going to interrupt each other.
[22:56] Mel Robbins: It's okay.
[22:57] Mel Robbins: But I want you to listen closely to what Jake shares because it is really important.
[23:05] Jake Shane: I'm a really confident guy, but I do not like how I feel about my body and I don't like how I feel about how I look on the outside.
[23:17] Mel Robbins: Okay.
[23:17] Jake Shane: Like like I'll look in the mirror and I'll like take my sides and I'll like pull them back like this.
[23:22] Mel Robbins: I've done that.
[23:23] Jake Shane: I would like to like just shave my sides off.
[23:25] Jake Shane: Um, I like have a bigger like bosom area.
[23:30] Mel Robbins: Uh-huh.
